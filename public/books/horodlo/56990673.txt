Rachel Platt (Zisberg) (Haifa) about the youth of Haradla.


I want to convey, according to my possibilities, a picture about the activity of the Harodler youth, about their cultural life and about their striving to learn and progress in the educational and cultural field. Although Horodla was a small town, and the possibilities to acquire education were limited. Evidently there was an exemplary youth in Horadla, of a high culture and knowledge level, who distinguished himself with his strong urge to acquire his education and knowledge and to make progress in all areas. The Horodler youth received their cultural education under difficult conditions and mainly by studying alone. You could find in Horodla a large number of Jewish scholars and Torah scholars, as well as adults and younger youths, who studied and fulfilled themselves in such conditions in which there was a lack of resources and finances, and despite this they succeeded.


To wonderful discoveries. The cultural activity in our town was concentrated around the cultural library. In the club of the library, we used to conduct meetings, parties, and just the usual youth gatherings. Twice a week serious literary contests were held in the club, which were held by adult youths who had knowledge in literature, and they kept the conference rent unpaid. We helped ourselves in our cultural work with our own cultural powers. Each one tried to pass on his knowledge to the others and help them in their culture in addition to education. While looking for cultural forces from outside, we wanted to see in this.
