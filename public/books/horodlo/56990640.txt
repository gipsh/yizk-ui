Haradla, our small town (memories).


Your heart is filled with blood and you have tears in your throat when you have to sit down to write about the town of Horodla. You write about your hometown, where you were born, how you spent the spring of your life and how you dreamed so many dreams, weaved so many dreams... You left your nearest and dearest, you left your childhood and youth behind. When leaving a lively Jewish town, with all the Jewish charms, which is so embedded in your heart, so longed for in your soul, and now you are writing about the memories... because many memories are left of the whole living past and of the former life. ... it stings you at the heart, it tugs at your soul, when you dip your pen not only in ink, but in the blood and the tears with which your whole being has been shed, and you try to create at least on paper a Part of the memorial after the hometown Harodla. .
