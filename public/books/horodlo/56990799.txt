12) R. David Joseph Zuberman ZL: The Zuberman family was a branched and varied one. The members of this family, who mostly lived in Horodla and some of them moved after the marriage to live in other cities, were interesting people and occupied a prominent place in the social life of Horodla. The leaders of the family occupied a prominent place among the Haradler scholars and occupied the top in the synagogue and in the stable. The sons - the second generation of the Zuberman brothers - went on a similar path, during the time they were among the Beit Midrash sitters, they were considered among the most distinguished of the scholars. And after they left the learning bank, and began to engage in worldly things, they stood at the head of the social and social activity in Haradla, and carried the burden of the Zionist work in the town. .
