A memorial book The strange fate, the historical fate that accompanied the Jewish people in the Horodla exile did not escape our city either.
Many Jews from our town took the wand in hand many years ago before the rise of the Nazi beast in Germany and in the European countries, and with the hope of a brighter tomorrow, they left for the distant lands. From America, Canada, Brazil, and to other South American countries
Among them there were those who were disgusted with the exile life in Poland and also the new exiles and decided to immigrate to the Land of Israel, our fatherland, and join the ranks of its builders and pioneers, thank you This remains a remnant of the Horadler community, which perished in the European Holocaust, and the small camp that is left can (and is also obliged to) erect a tombstone in the form of memorial leaves after the saints of the Horadler community, this Are our parents, brothers and sisters, who were gruesomely murdered together with the other six million Jews by the German murderers, in the Second World War
These saints, whose bodies were burned in the crematoriums of Auschwitz, Treblinka, Savivar and other death camps, were not even entitled to a sign on their grave, and no tombstones were erected in their honor.
They did not even have the right to come to Israel's grave, but their holy ashes were scattered on the Polish and German soil, like garbage on the field.
 


However, if a stone tombstone has not been erected after them, a different kind of tombstone, a spiritual tombstone, must be erected in it.
