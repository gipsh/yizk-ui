Years that I used to get up quite early to study in the synagogue, the first person who used to come before me was R. Chaim Hersh, whom I used to find in the corner reciting the Psalms with intention. In the Horodler panorama, three Jews were distinguished, the most rectorist types of Horodler life, whose livelihood was the drawing of water from the urban well and bringing it in two buckets to the Jewish houses, these were: Wolf (or as people He used to be called Wolveniu), Capel, who was also the city of Kbarn RL, and Deborah, who for a certain period also made a living from water burials. You have to remember that at that time, people in the small towns.
