It is difficult to describe the terrible picture, and the moments of leaving the town, where these Jews lived, they, their parents and their ancestors for many generations, not knowing where they are being led and what the murderers are. Think with them to do. It was heartbreaking to see the unfortunate outcasts leaving the city dragging their feet to an unknown place. Tired, both physically and mentally and oppressed, the exiles arrived in Ochan, in a place. As there were thousands of expelled and refined Jews from the surrounding cities and from the nearby villages, they were arranged in tight little rooms, as other families had already lived and we waited with fear for what was to come. It was hard to imagine that the next station would lead to the Tut camp. .


Even in Ochan, our life was free. In a day, some cars with s. s. agents. When they saw the gathered Jews in the market, they got out of the car and selected fifty Jews from among the evicted, they ordered them to lie down on the ground, and killed them with machine guns. After that, they ordered us to clean up the dead, while the murderers sat down and gave Brunem sandwiches to eat. .


The deportation to the death camp that it has been eight days, an order was received, we need to gather in the market of Ochan, around two thousand people have gathered in the market. We were put on farmers' wagons that were specially brought, and we were taken to Munich, we were not told what the purpose of the trip was and where we were being taken. When we were on the road, the foreman - the gentile - asked me: Do you know how people drive you? You are taken to the crematoriums. I told the good words to the rabbi who didn't want to believe it. When we arrived in München - (a way to help at the 15 km from Zamość).
