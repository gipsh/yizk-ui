- Well, what can I say. You are a man after all, and how should I know what we have to do? In my opinion, we don't have to leave our home. What are we going to do on the road, it is difficult for us to waddle across the road and drag our children along. We fought so hard until we got this house, and now we should leave them to HFCR? - And yet you are hidden in the affairs of the Gentiles around us. They already know us, and they also know that we have no money. You don't have to run away. This is a useless thing that will not bring any use. And then he would narrow his eyes and say: What do I know? Maybe you are right. Where will we escape? - The winter is coming, maybe God will help us and there will be peace in the world. Maybe! However, if the situation worsens, we will flee from here in the summer.


But the future showed that neither escaping nor staying in the place could save the Jews. Their bitter end was sealed, as it is known to us, the remnant of the Haradla refugee. .

Among the lowest and greatest gentiles were the three brothers Partsyanik-Imach Shamm, the three brothers Sarabakovitt, not supposed to be them, Bianek Donchek, and especially the lowly heartless Zigmund Szymnicki, these and others found their pleasure in robbing the unfortunate Jews from the town. They used to go through the Jewish houses and say: - Listen to me, I can do what you don't need today.
