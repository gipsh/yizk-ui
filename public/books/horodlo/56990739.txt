Jacob Seidel, and told that they heard that the Germans are preparing to carry out a great slaughter tomorrow, and according to their opinion, it is better to escape from Hrubishov.
We agreed to meet at 12 o'clock at night
At night we left Hrubishov on the way to Mruchin, we were forced to cross the water of
Lachevi, which was cold as day, and at dawn we arrived at Horodla
We stayed near the grain and hay barns
And we searched a lot
We entered the shed of Wobrishbits, we went up to the hayloft and we laid down.
We looked for bread in the barn, and we found a piece of bread in the farmer's jacket that was hanging in the shed, and we divided it between us, we lay without moving for a whole day.
At night I decided to go into the house of Vabrisbein and ask for food
His surprise was great when I appeared in his house
I told him that we ran away from Horobyshov and we were looking for food, and he should also allow us to hide in his shed, he gave us food but he asked us to leave the shed because he was afraid of the Germans.
Having no choice, we left our shelter and went into the fields, a blizzard came and threw our faces with pieces of snow.
Without hope, we asked ourselves - where should we go? I proposed to go to Nakhomol to Stashin and hide in the floors of the long stodoles, because I suspected that people come to these stodoles only rarely and we would be able to stay there for a longer time.
We arrived at the station and hid in an attic of a building
We saw that below the horses were eating white berets, one of us went down and took them out


The trough a few bunches of beets and we ate. In the morning, we hear footsteps in the attic that are walking and approaching, and we hear that those who are approaching are speaking Yiddish. We raise our heads and we see Ichele Strizhever with his son and others.
