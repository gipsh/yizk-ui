Events that took place in Haradla in the years 1939-1942 (memoirs of an eyewitness).


The first German soldiers who were brought to Haradla after its occupation by the German army were border soldiers. Their main task was to guard the new Russian-German border that was established along the river Bug. According to an agreement of both countries. .


These soldiers settled in the houses of the Jews, in the houses that the Germans liked, while the Jewish inhabitants were put out on the cold winter street of 1939.
A significant number of these Jews died of hunger and cold during the first winter of the German occupation.
I remember that in January 1940 the Germans began their terrible acts and their systematic persecution of the Jews.
Along with the cruel decrees on the Jews, the Germans published notices that threatened with reprisals and with severe punishments, all those who will give help to a Jew, in any way
During the period that continued between June 1941 - the time of the German attack on Russia - the German acts of murder were of a limited character and they did not carry out any mass murder.
In June 1940, the border soldiers left Horadla and in their place arrived other soldiers whose task was to introduce a Nazi regime in the city.
With the advance of the German army deep into Russia, the Germans began to worry about good roads and about the explosion.
