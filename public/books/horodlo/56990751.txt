A procession, people used to bring them to the city market, and they were scattered and shot on all sides. It is difficult to describe the panic and confusion that it used to break out, and the running of the Jews, who fled as long as they could. Sometimes S.S. used to show up. crowds from the Krain, and demanded a number of Jews to work. And those who were forced to go to work with them. They did not return. One night Germans appeared in our house and demanded that my father send his sons to work. We then lay hidden in the attic, and we could hear how the father said that he did not know where we were, we were afraid that the Germans would search the house, and we quickly snuck out of the attic and saw Off into the night. .


b. The expulsion.


On a bitter and unexpected day, an order arrived from the German government in Harubishoib to expel the Haradler Jews. I remember how a Ukrainian guy appeared at Undu's house and proposed to the father that he sell our house to him, because anyway the house will belong to others after the expulsion of the Jews. My father's answer still rings in my ears: I believe that Hitler will not be able to exterminate all the Jews, and the survivors will take revenge for the Jewish blood. On the day of the expulsion, all the Jews were concentrated in the city of Mark, and we were led to the city of Ochan. In Ochan, they concentrated us in a sheepfold, and we were there for two weeks. Of course, the Germans did not provide us with food or other articles, and we sustained our lives with the meager food that we managed to bring with us from home. In Ochan we did nothing and we waited for the next with great trepidation. Within a day, the Germans informed us that we had to move on.
