Five brothers were the Ket family: Rev. David Joseph Zuberman, Rev. Jacob Zuberman, Rev. Zvi Zuberman, Rev. Moshe Zuberman, Rev. Aaron Zuberman, and each one of them had his definite place in Haradler's life. The common feature of all of them was that they were all scholars, honest people and had general knowledge. They themselves acquired their spiritual baggage thanks to their desire for Torah and knowledge. .


At the head of the five brothers went R. David Yosef with his tall figure and personality. R. David Yosef was a great scholar. He was interested in many things and was .


An expert in many areas, and it was not known how and when he acquired his skills and knowledge.
He was humble and his simplicity and humility covered his knowledge and his skills.
He was always in the Beit Midrash, and for many hours he used to study in his appointed place
He was the permanent teacher in the Beit Midrash and his prayer was like an old Urgil
Even when he was sitting in his shop, he didn't waste his free time. Whenever there were no customers in the shop (and in the Haradler economy this was a common phenomenon), he would immediately open one of His books that he used to always give: Talmud, Chomesh, Mishniyot, A
A
hook

And used to enter the spiritual world
Rabbi David Joseph loved the Hebrew language and its treasures
and was content to immerse himself in intellectual matters and in research and scientific books
And when the Tzifira appeared under the editorship of Yosef Heftman Zel, Rabbi David Yosef read the important and insightful articles of the newspaper with great interest and pleasure.
 


Along with his love for books, he also loved physical work. He used to like to engage in work that required physical effort, and he undertook such work in his yard and his home. .
