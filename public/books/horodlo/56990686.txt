When approaching from the front, the Horodler Jews hid in shelters and in the numbered sturdy cellars that also served as shelters against the artillery fire. My family together with a number of other families hid in the house of Mendel Lerner which was a side house and we found them for Fasik as a hiding place. It is easy to imagine the fear that gripped the people in hiding when I returned to the house and told them that the Germans had entered the city. .


On the second day of their arrival, some German soldiers appeared in the room of Mendel Lerner's house, the Uysi considered.


Excavations that we made in the yard as a protection against bombardment they called us to them, and told us that we made the excavations in order to shoot at the German windows from there, they told us to stand by the wall and raise the hands We understood that they wanted to shoot us and we started begging them and explaining to them that the excavation serves us as protection. Fluzim, a German captain appeared and ordered the soldiers to immediately put themselves on the market. A lord wanted us to be killed and we were saved by a miracle. Later that same evening, the Germans made their presence felt in Horodla. They broke up Moshe Tenenbaum's shoe business, they threw all the goods into the gutter in front of the Poles who gathered with sacks to seize the Jewish property, and in a short while Moshe Tenenbaum's property, which he had worked on for a while, was destroyed. Many years. .


The next morning, they broke open other Jewish shops and threw out the goods to the Polish crowd. There were a number of shops left, which it was difficult to break open, and the Germans gave up the effort to break them open. In about two days, it was Yom Kpur, we realized that the German army was retreating. One could see how they put together the telephone wires and tie their tents. We did not understand this.
