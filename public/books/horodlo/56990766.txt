And this is what happened to the Jews of Haradla and the surrounding area in Munich: we arrived in Munich in the late afternoon hours, and we found many Jewish victims scattered in the area surrounding the railway station.
These people were killed by the Germans because they could not get on the train cars quickly during the extermination action that the Germans carried out that day.
A day before we were brought to Munich, the Jews from the nearby cities were brought there: Ochan, Grabovitz, and other cities, and when we arrived there we still met the fifty thousand Jews, crowded together giving the train Station in a terrible crowd, because the place was too crowded for such a large number
Twelve freight wagons were parked separately at the railway station
The Nazis gave a new order to the trapped crowd to divide into two hosts
in the camp of Jews up to the age of 18 years and from the age of fifty years and beyond, and a second camp from the age of eighteen to fifty years
This was the most tragic moment for the Haradler Jews and for the Jews from the other cities, on their last way to the extermination camp.
 


The families were brutally divided and were broken up according to their age. The men and the children up to the age of eighteen years and the men and women from the age of fifty years and below were taken with cruelty and terrible deeds in the cargo cars of the train that left in the direction of Savivar. The men of the second camp at the age of 18-50 were mostly also taken on other freight cars after the women of the same age were separated from us. I was then under the age of 18, and yet I broke down and was pushed into the fuller camp (18-50). Our train left MÃ¼nzin in the direction of Helles at night and we arrived at Hellem the next morning. in .
