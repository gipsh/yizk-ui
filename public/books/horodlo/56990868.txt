A prayer in the grave. .


Oh, stand up, my pious mother, and look even now how the people who run and pray for your only child are of Jewish blood. .


The world is so beautiful and I don't enjoy it, I lie hidden, alone, woe is me. .


You should accept my tears and according to the request to God that my love should not be lost, he should accept my commandment. .


Stand up my young brothers and don't be silent anymore. Don't make a fuss, it shouldn't be your blood. .


Take arms in your hand and run and fight! Makes all of Germany, I want to experience the revenge. .
