Your appreciation Mordechai.


Kaddish, after the place of birth, an anniversary candle, in which the severed souls of saints, who were not allowed to die until the last breath of their lives, but were murdered by a blood storm, are lit in the trunks of all the saints. The four corners of the world, who put their souls in mourning and clothe their hearts with sorrow. .


At the beauty of the soul, the figure of the small Jewish town, which is so close because of the former life and because of the not far away death of the dearest and dearest, appears in the darkness. .


Horadla was small, but a world unto itself, a Jewish kingdom in miniature. One of those Jewish towns in Poland, how people lived a Jewish life, a whole, how the air was Jewish, the river, the market. People immersed themselves in Judaism, breathed with Judaism. .


The voice of the Torah sang out of the rooms with grace and sincerity. The erudition escaped from the madrasims, the acrimony looked down on the genius rabbi and piety drowned out the virtues, full of butchers, boys with a thirst for knowledge read the books of the Bibi Liotek and sang youth crossed themselves in the pioneer organizations. A dreamy glow attracted the eyes of the members of the dramatic section, and happiness shone from the pioneers who ignited with their zeal. The voice of prayer went out on the Sabbath and during the week of my house.
