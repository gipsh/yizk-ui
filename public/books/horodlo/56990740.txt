Three strijever Jews (I don't remember their names). They were afraid of us and started to run away. We quietly called them by name and they returned to us. .


We are going to get bread We have worked out a plan to get food and bread
One stray Jewer told us that he has some goods for a women's group and we need to exchange it for food at one of the farmers, who will go and carry out this business? We cast lots and it fell on me and Fishel Shek, but Fishel Girtel shared with me that he made a vow not to leave me and to accompany me on all my journeys and he agreed to go with us.
But we were told that three cannot go, because they can attract attention, so Fishel's check remained in the stable and I went with Fishel's belt.
We went to Harodla and we knocked on the door of a farmer named Jashka Meronie, we went in and offered the farmer the goods for bread.
The girl told us that she has no bread now, and advised us to hide in the attic of the shed for the time being, until she kneads dough and bakes bread.
A thing that will last for long hours
We did what she told us, the next morning at night, in the late hours, she gave us some bread for the goods, which she tied together with a rope, and we left Horodla and went to Stashin, I remember that We asked her for a bag for the bread and we promised her to return it, but she said that she was afraid that maybe they would kill us and she would lose the bag.
After we got into the road, a strong wind started blowing, and a heavy snow started to fall, which washed away the road leading to Stashin.
When we came to the brick kiln of Murcia, we found the road completely washed away
We have tried to adjust our path according to our own
