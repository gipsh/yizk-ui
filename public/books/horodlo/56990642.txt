A wonderful thing happened here: the horses that were harnessed in the plow died, even before they started to plow. I remember that in 1935, Fritz Wieshbitsky sold his property, and also wanted to sell the cemetery as a field of grain. The rabbi of the city, Rabbi Moshe Leib Halevi Berman, and my father, Rabbi Yosef Bergman, went to him to ask him not to sell the cemetery, and they told him what had happened to the horses of The previous priest while he wanted to weaken the house of life. The priest burst out laughing. .


When a few days had passed, he sent for my father Zel, and informed him that he was leaving the Beit Olam in the possession of the Jewish community, because he was afraid of a decline in the Beit Olam, adding that a few days ago He suddenly fell ill and went to bed. When we used to walk on the road that leads to Ostila, we used to go up to the Beit Chaim, and consider the writing on the old tombstones that were sunk into the ground. We found there old tombstones with dates from 150 years ago. .


The hill near the Beit Midrash, not far from the Beit Midrash, was a small mound of earth, fenced and surrounded by secrecy.

They also told that the writer An-Ski visited the place before writing his book, and wanted to hear this story about the mysterious hill. .

The rabbi was known in Poland as an important rabbi and a great Torah scholar, and the Horodler community was proud of the fact that they were privileged to have such a great and important spiritual leader. .
