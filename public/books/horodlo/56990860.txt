Keller determined the location of the stone and gave us the direction of the execution. We dictated to the technician the inscription that he should engrave on the memorial stone. .


After the craftsman finished the engraving and fixed the stone in the wall of the ruined basement, next to the tombstones of other churches, we left a group of Haradler countrymen. Together with Berman, they went to Jerusalem, Z. Nisan Tshiz, and we went up to Mount Zion, united to be with the memory of the saints of Haradler Jewry, and the saints of European Jewry - in the basement of the Shoah. With a holy shudder, we turned our gaze to the direction of the old city of King David, which is in the hands of the enemy, to the direction of the Temple Mount. The site of our former Temple, and to the direction of Mount Hatsuf, and.


We considered the Zion Wall, which reminds us of the Jewish fortresses and Jewish heroes. Taken from the sanctity of the place of the memories of our great past. Memories about the period of the kings of Judah. Memories about the greatness of Israel in the past, about our prophets and visionaries, we continued our way to the destruction basement. Wrapped in grief and pain. We considered the evidence of the tragic destruction. The collection of the remains of murder and fine: holy Torah books soaked in the blood of the sacrificial saints. Shrouds of Torah scrolls that were destroyed by the terrible enemy, holy books that were soaked with tears, and boxes of ashes of the saints that were burned in the crematoriums by the unworthy Nazis. With silence and trembling, we stood and read the engraved words on the memorial stone after the Haradler church and we united with the holy memory of the Haradler martyrs and with the Jewish martyrs in general. .


While the cantor of the mountain arranged the commemoration after the saints of Haradla, give place as it rests David king of Israel, while he was with his.
