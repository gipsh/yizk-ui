Moshe Berer is especially busy for the holiday of Moshe the Beder. In the early hours of the morning on the eve of Yom Tov, he begins to fill the mikvah with clean spring water, after he has emptied the previous water. Moshe Beder stands at the wooden bucket in the early morning and pours them into the wooden gutter that leads them to the Mikva Torah. For long hours he is busy collecting water, without stopping he pulls up the bucket and empties it until the mikvah is filled with water. Finished filling, he heats up the steam, slides the sweat stones on the big stove. And in the late morning hours, the first Jews from the city begin to come, bathe and clean themselves in honor of the holiday. .


Zelik the Gabbay One of the busiest people in the Eve Yom Tov days is Zelik the Gabbay, who with his black long aristocratic beard used to arouse awe. R. Zelik was an inseparable part of the Haradler panorama, and was respected by everyone. .


He carried an important public task on his shoulders for a long time: R. Zelik was responsible for the order and cleanliness of the Great Shel. R. Zelik fulfilled his task faithfully, and he used to help clean, rub and polish the large heavy copper hanging lamps with his own hands, while cleaning the water hand basin and filling it, and he did not stop working until the shell had Shining with its light and purity, and he also did not forget to prepare drink and honor for a Kiddush Rabbah after praying - Be honorable and drink, Jews! - Cheers, Jews! Cheers! And his face lightened with great satisfaction. .

Oh, woe! To the Holy Church, to all the dear ones who were killed without guilt by the German murderers yesterday. May the holy memory of the church and its saints remain forever! .
