Others
I was secretaries of the Leitung and Tahila Grassboard the cashiers
We used to get together often at Berel (Dub) Grassbird - a tea party, and we used to discuss our activities and plans.
The most active among the women was Beile Freind
She almost never missed any work or any party, and you could always find her among the food distributions for the children.
Among the youth organizations in those years, the Bitar, which embraced the greater part of the youth, stood out more.
The Ken Secrei Toriat often used to come to his meetings at our house as well
Because my younger brother Moshe was then the secretary of Betar and the commander of Hakan was Zvi Zaltzman
Some of the better activists are today in Israel and Argentina
For many years, my adopted brother Henech was in charge of the work of the Rise of Israel Foundation
I remember that when I left Horodla to go to Argentina, I told my brother to follow in my footsteps and he answered me: For 18 years I have been the heir of Kern Kimat, and I have the right to receive it. A certificate to pass to the Land of Israel, I hope to receive such a certificate
Oh, woe! He was not entitled to that, his fate was the same as that of the Polish Jews, who were killed by the German Nazis yesterday, and there remains a great pain and longing for the dear ones who were and are no longer there.
