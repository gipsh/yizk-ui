In his mother's house. But he no longer found his mother and his brothers, and in their place he found the Polish barber - who turned out to be an ardent Nazi during the German occupation - and who handed him over to the Germans who detained him and Refine him to death. This is what the Christian Stashka told us. .


In one of the evenings, a guy from the village came to us and told us that the young rabbi (the rabbi's son-in-law) who had just arrived from Horadla was now with him. I immediately left for the Gentiles' house, and I actually found the young rabbi there who told me that he had escaped from Harodla, and that there were many Jewish dead in Horodla and that the Germans had buried him before he escaped. The dead give birth. The next morning we went together and approached the bow. We saw the old rabbi from a distance surrounded by Germans who forced him to be buried.


Gotta. When the Germans saw us from a distance, they started shooting at us. We sneaked out of the place. The next morning, the captain of the Russian guard appeared and in his hand he held the turban of the young rabbi, which he had earlier ambushed during his escape. The story happened in 1940. Close to that time, an instruction was given by the Soviet security forces, that it was invited for the people inside to be on the nearest places of the border and that we had to pass no Russia, we then left our new temporary residence, and we left for Russia.
