to Lviv .


Love Pradl! I am letting you know that I remained an orphan just like you, the mother and Sarah went out on the day 10.8.1942 on the same road on which your mother was sent. I stayed with my mother's friend. I do not lack any food, but I am very unhappy. It is now with us madam slaughter. I don't have any news from Warsaw and that worries me a lot. If you write to the grandmother, you should ask her on my behalf to go to the grandfather's label and let him know everything. Write later, because I am lonely and your letter will comfort me a little. Goodbye, Your Highness.


n. b. I have no news of my dear father. .
