R. Yosef Hecht as well as the other panelists and craftsmen were closely connected with Jewish life in Haradla, and they distinguished themselves with their Jewish simplicity and modesty. .


J) The Bel-Eglaheim: the trade in Haradla in all its areas was mostly in Jewish hands, and the Haradlar shopkeepers bought their goods in the three nearby towns: in Harobyshov, which was 14 km to the west. In Ustila, which was 7 km away and was located on the other side of the river Bug, to the east, in Ludmir, which is also on the eastern bank of the Bug, 18 km from Haradla. .


In Ustila, the Haradler shopkeepers used to buy only small and urgent purchases, while the larger and important purchases were made in Horubishuib and Ludmir. .


Four were responsible for the traffic between Haradle and the neighboring towns of Sohora: Hershele Freind, Ntele Shruber, Moshe Michael (or as he was called: Moshe Mechel), and Moshe Hak. .

Good horses and strong wagons, with long, wide ladders that enabled the proper loading of goods and traveling in the distance, Moshe Mechel and Moshe Hak had weak, creaking wagons whose wheels shook to and fro and during the work, added Riltz. and were drawn by one weak horse, which was not properly fed. It is therefore no longer surprising that the two masters knew that they could only introduce themselves.
