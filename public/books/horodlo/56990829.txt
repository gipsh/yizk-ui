Haradler figures.


A group of Haradler countrymen sat on a rainy Sunday evening, in the house of Jacob and Rebecca Medderdrot, and gave the writer of these lines memories of the small Polish Jewish town of Lublin province, Haradla, about a number of characteristic Christian types and about Episodes that happened there. Outside, a heavy rain was pouring down and here, in the house, the image of the cut-off town was illuminated and warmed, through the mouths of his surviving sons and daughters, who carry it deep in their hearts, with longing and sadness. Each countryman remembered himself in a different type and in a different episode, and from all the broken descriptions and brief characteristics, he got a glorious picture of what Haradla was: a town full of Torah and good deeds, and a pride


embraced me, from being born in such a place. And I thought for a long time and came to the conclusion that it was not for nothing that such great geniuses and lights came out of such small towns that illuminated the Jewish world, and that is why we still draw our spiritual inspiration from those small Jewish towns in Poland. Lithuania, Hungary, Russia, etc., who soaked and dipped in the best qualities of our nation. .


In this conversation, a whole gallery of various Haradler Jews floats up, each one of them could serve as a central figure of a book about Polish Jewry. .
