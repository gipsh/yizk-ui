From my office as mayor, and on my flat, Prince Fadebinski of the village of Ribene was chosen. In 1918 I left Horodla and went to Kiev. After I had been in Russia for about four years and had tasted the taste of the mothers of the Russian revolution, I returned to Harodla in 1922. Some youth had left the benches of the Beit Midrash. The majority of the youth exchanged their Hasidic clothing for European clothing. Anti-Semitism became stronger and the enemies of Israel raised their heads. The economic regime of the new Poland (Grabowski's regime) impoverished most of the Jews. A large part of the youth began to think of emigrating to distant countries. .


In view of the situation in Poland, I also decided to migrate to another country with a secure future. After a long journey, I arrived in the United States. In order to get a permit to enter America, I was forced to go to Chisinau and stay there for a certain period of time. During my stay in Keshtenv, I got a job that enabled me to support myself, and in Keshtenv I also met my future wife. After spending some time in the pocket, I arrived in the United States in 1925. .
