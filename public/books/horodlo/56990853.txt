The grandfather was a dear master of prayer. There was a special Menin at Son Tzvi, but on bad days they went to the nearby town of Ustile. .


I was no more than four years old then, but I still remember like today the happy Saturday evening, at three feasts. At the time. Each son and son-in-law was greeted by the grandfather with a song. We, all the grandchildren, danced and danced in the dark until there was a knock on the window. This was given by the Gentiles, that there are already stars in the sky, and my father they are already opening the cross and selling them kerosene. .


The grandfather was highly esteemed by all the gentiles of the village and even by the authorities. So that once he refused to take an oath in court and he was released from it. .

At the end of the war, when my brothers, Queenen, and many young people from the town began to leave the bank in the Shtibel and the Beit Midrash, and began to surrender to Zionism, Hebrew, pioneers, the Zubermans with the Goldbergs. Lerners, Zavidwiches, Herbst, Stowes. Biedermans, Berbans, and many others, formed the so-called intelligentsia Sin Shtetl. But, how beautiful life was! .
