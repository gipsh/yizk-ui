Gathered at the home of Sarah Mindel Rosenblum to recite the Psalms. (They lived in Sarah Mindlen's house the whole time after the outbreak of the war). We thought that maybe the murderers would recall the terrible decree. .

The sisters Sheindil and Pradil Ravenblum.


Deportation. People who were employed in field work by landowners and farmers of the area were excluded from this order. The Jews ran to the farmers and asked them to take them to work without any wages, in many cases the unfortunate ones promised to pay the farmers for their work. A person cannot imagine the horrific picture, how a whole community, men, women and children, are taken out of their own.
