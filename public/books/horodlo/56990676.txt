But that's not how our parents explained it. A theater performance was considered by them as a wrong thing, an invitation, and they decided to disturb us and not allow us to the performance. In the evening of the performance, it became known to us that the parents, headed by the city youth, are preparing to come to the performance site and to destroy the stage and the preparations for the performance, it is understandable that we have decided to defend our cause and Not allowing them to realize their intention, and to carry out the performance under all circumstances, we set aside a strong week for the entrance of the performance hall, and we did not allow the demonstrators to enter. This struggle was difficult and uncomfortable for us. Because it is difficult for children to hang out with their parents, and grandchildren with their grandparents. But we decided to do our thing. .


I will never forget this encounter. I remember that while I and another friend were going to the performance, we heard voices and violence from a distance. These were the voices of those who were fighting, which reached in the distance and to the nearby villages. By the way, the farmers of the area, who did not know the motive of the quarrel, thought that the Jews were being discriminated against - something that was close to their heart - and they started running in the direction of the quarrel. Armed with sticks. sickles and shovels, and when they came to the place of the war, and a strange and unusual picture was revealed to them, they went back from where they came. .


The collision ended without mutual consent. People arrived only with shouts and threats. The young man stood his ground, and the performance went on without any problems. The collision caused bitterness and anger between many parents and children for a long time, until they were replaced. It should be emphasized that not only men came to star.
