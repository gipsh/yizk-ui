Remember the destruction of Israel...Remember the destruction of Israel, remember the loss and the upheaval and let it be a sign and a lesson to change generation after generation; And let this memory accompany you always when you walk on your way and when you lie down and when you get up: and I leave you forever the memory of brothers who are no more; And the remembrance came in your flesh, in your blood and in your bones: gnash your teeth and remember; You eat your bread - remember; By drinking your waters - remember; Sing because you will hear - remember; at sunrise he is male; And when the night comes - remember; and in the day


Remember a holiday and a memorial date: And your house because you built it and left it in a breach, so that the house of Israel will be a ruin against you always: Gilead and Seda because you will become deaf And you set up in it a stone god for the brothers who did not come to the grave of Israel: and you were ashamed that you would lead your children and you raised on the head of your joy the memory of the children who were not ashamed. They shall be brought forth again: and they shall be one: the living and the dead: the departed and the remnant: those who have gone and are not - and those who have remained to the plate: listen, O Israel, to the voice that calls to you from the depths : Don't shed my blood, go, don't shed my blood. .
