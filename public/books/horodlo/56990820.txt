The heroism of Isaac Saler. .


In memory of my deceased brothers and their families, David and Mendel Schechter.


Let me tell you the life path of Yitzchak Saler Zel, of course you will wonder why I found it necessary to count the life story of this Yitzchak and describe it, more than any other resident of our town? Therefore, I will answer you that I do this because he was my closest neighbor, I knew him better than anyone in the town, I saw him often, and I knew about his motherhood and his difficulties in finding a living.
I can point out that I lived in his neighborhood for over twenty-five years
He was a middle-aged man, tall and thin, with a blond goatee.
You, like all Jews, an honest man, with a pure and kosher soul
All days he used to wander around the villages around Haradla looking for a living for his family
He used to find sustenance for himself and his children by buying a lot of wheat or barley from the farmers in the area, a little pig's hair, a piece of a slaughtered calf, and selling them to others.
So he also had a mother at home who gave him milk and he also traded in tobacco
In short: he was a poor man just like that


Most of the Jews of the town. He used to walk around from morning to night with an open hood, from which his chest was visible, he used to sing a Hasidic song under it, and at the end he used to . He loudly croaked with his hands and said: Oh, God, my divorce! And what will we do? , people.
