For many years, even in his old age, when he was already weak, he used to strain his legs and used to make long distances to find the Harodler Oremeleit and hand over the dead Hittin to them. .


The tragic events and the Great Holocaust completely changed the Jewish map. The Horodler community was destroyed, and the small number that remained spread all over the world. It is our duty to erect a memorial to the dear Harodlar community. In response to the call to publish a book of remembrance, we have gathered together some of the Haradlers in the United States: Berman, Rabbi Chaim Berman, Moshe Biederman, Esther and Jacob Tish, Getzel Zis, Israel Fox, Aaron Fox and the writer of the lines, and We have decided to help realize the initiative with written materials, with the collection of pictures and documents and with financial assistance. Let this book of remembrance serve as an eternal memorial to the saints of Horodla, whose blood was shed by the barbarians! .
