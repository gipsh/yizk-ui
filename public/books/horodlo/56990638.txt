As a forest merchant, he was busy all day in the forest as the representative of a large wood company, and forgot, when returning from work, he used to sit in the synagogue for many hours and study with great interest. On Friday nights he used to study almost all night. So also almost the entire Sabbath. While studying, he used to stand, resting his leg on a bench, and splashed and swam in the sea of the Talmud. Rabbi Shimon Moshe Goldberg, his sons: Hen and Shmuel, his son-in-law Isaac Lerner, Rabbi Aaron Yehuda Halevi friend and his sons: Rabbi Yosef, Rabbi Avraham, Rabbi David. Rabbi Leibish Goldberg, Rabbi Pinchas Berger, Rabbi David Joseph Zuberman, his sons: Leibel Zuberman, Betz Zuberman, Zvi Zuberman. .


Rabbi Jacob Zuberman and his family, sons, daughters and grandchildren. .
