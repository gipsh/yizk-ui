Remember the Jewish holocaust. .


Remember the catastrophe of our nation, remember the battle and the destruction - and learn a lesson from them. .


And let this remember be a companion with you, when you go on the road, when you sleep and when you wake up. .


And let the memory of the catastrophe be salt in your bread and let it enter you, into your blood, into your flesh and bones. .


And a house that you will build, break into a wall - so that you can always see before your eyes the destruction of the House of Israel. .


And that you will plow a field - place a mountain of stones in it - as a witness and memory for brothers who did not come to the grave of Israel. .


And that you will take your child to the Huppah - raise the memory of Jewish children, that they will never be taken to the Huppah - even in any Kaddish no one will ever say to them. .


And should become one! The dead - and the living, the torn - and the surviving; Those who are gone - and the rest of Israel. .


Listen, son and daughter of Israel, to the King who calls to you, do not be silent! Don't forget! .


Dir T. Dwarzhetsky.
