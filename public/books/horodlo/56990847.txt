Once the father became ill, due to an accident that he had suffered, and if that was not enough, the livelihood was not as good either. .


As usual, he also went to see the rabbi, R. Mordechai Yosef Elazar Zetzel, in Warsaw. The rabbi suddenly found out about his poor health and his poor economic situation. But my father, Zel, did not want to show this, so the rabbi asked him: - How is your income? , my father answered: And they walked around extensively, that is to say, quite nicely, and tried to cover everything with a cheerful face. The rabbi then told him to go to Atwatsk for recreation, and that he should not pray, because of his health, he did not allow it. Since he used to put his whole heart and strength into prayer, which was a famous thing. When the father, due to his illness, stopped going to the rabbi, the rabbi used to ask the other Haradler prominent Hasidim, who came to him in Warsaw: - What is Shmuel Haradler doing there with the Vathalchu in the area? (i.e. with the income). And this word spread in Hasidic circles. .


All the years, the father sang Shavuot Akdom, with a special tune (not sung in the traditional style, but sung with a tune). His academic singing is still remembered to this day, and awakens sweet memories. .


When he became ill, and did not dare to sing, his Hasidic enthusiasm drew him to pray and sing again and this time he also wanted to pray, then Shmuel Biederman approached him and addressed him: - Uncle, the rabbi didn't tell you to pray and sing, but the father, in his great Hasidic zeal, didn't want to know about anything. Then Shmuel Biederman wanted to restrain him a little more strictly and did not allow him to pray. .
