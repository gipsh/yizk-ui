My town Lord A. D. La. After years of absence, I returned to Haradla. This time it was in very sad circumstances, completely different from those that prevailed in her years ago, when I left her. Gone are the years of peace and stability, and the town found itself under a terrible war - along with all of Poland - riots and in terrible conditions for the Jewish community. I arrived in Horadla on a Friday afternoon, in the month of November 1939, with the aim of crossing the arch which was then the German-Russian border. The master Egla - with whom I traveled to Haradla - stopped before entering the city near the Polish school, because he was afraid to drive into the city with me, without me leaving him, and tried to enter the city through side streets. About, taking all kinds of precautionary measures, so as not to meet the Germans. .

Full of fear and without strength, I arrived at the house of Gitel Rose. A number of friends and relatives came to see me when they found out about my coming, and they advised me to leave the city immediately the way I came, despite the fact that it was close to night. These dear Jews told about the serious riots that prevailed in the city, and claimed that I could bring disaster on me and the Jews of the town, if the Germans would find out about my arrival. The people were full of fear and dread, and a depression reigned in the city. The Jews were afraid to go into the shul to receive Shabbat, and locked themselves in their houses for Shabbat prayer. By the beauty of the modest Shabbat light. .


At the beauty of the Saturday lights, which were visible from the Jewish houses through the windows here and there, filled with longing for the distant days, full of fear and pain, I quietly crept out of my town - From my birth nest, with feelings of loneliness and abandonment, and without the company of friends and relatives, I continued to look for an escape to my tired soul. .
