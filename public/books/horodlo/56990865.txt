Fradel Schiffer (pearl mother of pearl).


Canada. .


A sad story.


I will sing a sad song for you, my heart is like a stone. Let the whole world resound with this. How the murderers let us go out. .


When the Germans came to us, no one knew how they took our lives and killed us in the streets for nothing. .


They put white rags on our hands. His face burned for shame.


This is how our mothers and fathers went. The murderer should recognize us quickly. .


All days they were just thinking about how to deal with this. And so they made us die of starvation. .


In Lauern they caught men. Tortured there without bread. Tortured and beaten for so long. Until the dark day came. .
