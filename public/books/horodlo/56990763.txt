We were still in Haradla for about a year, and during that year we also tried to trade with the farmers who came from that side. We used to go to Ludmir, and we used to buy horses from the Ukrainians and sell them to the Horadlar farmers, and sometimes we used to bring them to sell in Horobyshov. But this trade brought us a great misfortune: my brother David Zal, who was the spirit of life and the most courageous in this trade, was caught by Polish anti-Semitic underground people, while returning from one of the trips to Ludmir , and they killed him. We mourned him a lot. After he went through so much suffering until the liberation, he fell a murderer. .


We understood that there is no longer any place for the Jews in their birthplace, and we traveled to Horobyshov, with the aim of waiting for the end of the war and to join the rest of the Jewish refugees who went to the Jewish homeland. .
