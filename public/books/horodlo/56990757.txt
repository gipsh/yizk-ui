We also dared to go in at night to a farmer and ask him for bread and food, and so we lay in the bunker for the whole winter. .


In one of the nights we went again to the village of Yankee
We remembered that a farmer owed money to my parents, and we decided to go to her and her husband instead of bread and wine for the debt.
The guy hired a willing person to help us and she said she was going to bring us bread
But it's been a long time and she hasn't returned
We wondered and inquired about it, but we thought maybe she didn't have bread ready and she was baking a pastry for us in the oven.
Refugees, to our great fear, a number of relatives from the Gentiles appeared and urged us to surrender ourselves to the Germans.
Without thinking much, I rushed to the door, broke it open, I jumped out, followed by my brother Shmuel, and we started to run away.
My brother Shmuel was caught by the end of his scarf, and to our luck, he freed himself from the scarf, which remained in the hands of the hunter.
We ran away in the darkness of the night, and people heard that we were being chased
 


Summer in the fields. Spring came, the air became pleasant, and the snow began to melt. But this pleasant season created a difficulty for us that we did not foresee beforehand: our bunker, which was dug in the Baden descent, was filled with the snow water. We were forced to sit in cold water all day. Because we were afraid to go out on the surface, and we suffered terribly from the humidity and cold. It became clear to us that we will no longer be able to use this storage. .
