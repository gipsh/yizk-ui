61 Jewish children, small, tied together by their small arms, one to the other, and their cries reach to the sky
After them, a German murderer arrived accompanied by a group of murderers, and after a definite preparation, he began to smash the heads of the apples with a stone and threw them into the pit.
This raging and fanatical riot shook all the Jews who still remained and completely oppressed them.
That it has been five months since we were in Stashin, the economic director Piszky came to me and told me that a German had come to ride on a bicycle and wanted to talk with me.
Of course, I ran into the field in a big panic and I didn't know what to do.
After meeting for a while, I returned to the economic director and asked him to find out in German what he wanted.
After a while, the director returned and told me that the German had brought me a letter.
I went to the German, and he told me that he came from Ludmir, and that he knew my brother Tevel and he gave me a letter from him, in the letter we wrote my brother Tevel and my sister Rebecca, I should They come to Ludmir
They also tell me that you can communicate with the German
The German offered me a ride on his bicycle to Ludmir, of course, that I had thought about his service readiness.
I left the farm and went on foot on a road that had no road until I came to the bow
I went to see a man named Biletsky who used to live near the Bug, and I proposed to him that he should help me cross the Bug for a sum of money that I will pay him for that.
As he didn't have a boat, we crossed the bow by swimming
I made two bundles of my clothes and belongings and I gave him the big bundle of clothes to keep
After crossing the Big, Biletsky returned to the other side taking the bundle of clothes with him, and I was left with the underwear on my body.
