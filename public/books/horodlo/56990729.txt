We opened the door, broke into the house with the fifteen Germans who were leading Fathi Blaszl with them, they woke up our whole family from their sleep and they took us all out, including the mother and small children. In the garden that surrounds our house, whose eastern border ended at a curved wall that goes down to the bow, we were lined up and we were told: that they know that we have money in the amount of 30 thousand Mark, and they demand that we give them the money
When we replied that we had no money, they told R. Fathi that he should convince us to confess and hand over the money to them.
And all of a sudden they pushed me and R. Fathi off the high mountain and we fell down to the bow, we got crushed in the clods of earth, in the thorns and glass, so that we couldn't get up.
They were ordered to go back upstairs
My mother and the little children told them to go home, and my father and I took them to the commander's office.
There they tied me up, and began to torture me and beat me on my shoulders, without stopping.
I fainted several times and each time they discouraged me with cold water that they poured on me.
My shirt was cut to fit so many beats
The captain told me: You won't find anyone alive if you don't hand over the money
You better save your life
I told him that he is hurting me for nothing, because I have no money, after that he took my father into a small cell that was specially built for torture.
We stood in the cell all night, because there was no place to sit while water dripped down on our chests.
In the morning, at 10 o'clock, the captain opened the cell and asked us loudly: have you freshened up a bit from the mascara?
We were ordered to leave the cell, we were driven down into the yard, and we were made to jump under the sports equipment in the yard, accompanied by Lef, and then we were released.
