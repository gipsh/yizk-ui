It's two o'clock in the morning in Hasidim Shtibel. Rabbi Shimon Wizenberg also taught until this hour. At two o'clock, when they finished studying, they used to go home together. Once, Rabbi Moshe Leib forgot to call Rabbi Shimonien when it was time.


The time came to go home, and Rabbi Shimon was so engrossed in his studies that he did not notice at all that Rabbi Moshe Leib had left.
When he realized that he was left alone, he decided to stay the whole night in the school, because he was afraid to go out of the school, because he needed to go through the school corridor where the purification board was and once People used to leave a tombstone in the passage, for her attitude to the house of life
In the same night, Rabbi Eliezer David's wife went to give birth, and her husband and family members went to the Chasidim stable to tie a thread to the door of the Holy Ark and to hand over the other end of the thread to the hand of the winner. As a remedy to give birth easily, when Rabbi Shimon heard the door being opened, he remembered the story that used to be told, that in the middle of the night the dead come into the school to pray, he made a leap in the Quickly to the window of the stable, break the pane and run outside
Rabbi Eleazar David's wife gave birth to a daughter that night. In the morning, when the first worshipers came to the stable, they were surprised at the great cold and saw the broken window.
When they inquired and investigated the meaning of it, they found out what happened to Rabbi Shimon at night, and that he escaped through the window.
 


How much beauty there was among the Horodler Jews, the Jews of the school and of the school children. .


Whoever said to his world: enough, will say to our troubles: enough, and we should be privileged to see the comfort of Zion! .
