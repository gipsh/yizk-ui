Beards together with the flesh of the face, the Horodlar Jews were pious and kept their beards with bravery and devotion, despite the fact that they were separated from the Germans.
Humiliated and oppressed, we were ashamed to raise our faces, because we could not bear the sight of the Gentiles who were late and rejoiced at our situation.
After four weeks, we heard for the first time about the death march of the Helemer and Harubishuber Jews.
With brutality and treachery, the German killers took out several thousand Jews (among them Liebele Zuberman).
They were gathered in the market and they were taken on foot to Belzitz, while the murderers were riding by their side.
Tired and broken, thousands of Jews dragged themselves

During their time, their enemies oppressed them and persecuted them
Those who were behind were shot on the way, the unfortunate ones tried to help each other and stopped those who were behind on their hellish way, but no Belzhits arrived without a trace of them, after a group of barely two women without food and a drink.
