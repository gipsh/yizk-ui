The Haradler Jews and their study.


A small town was Horodla
Its general number of inhabitants was not large
The Jewish population was also not numerous, but the Jewish Horodla, which was small in number, is considered an important community in terms of quality.
Each Harodler you was a big world, a world of its own
I will start with our Mera Dotra, Rabbi Hagaon Rabbi Moshe Leib Ztzel - the son-in-law of Rabbi Ikutiel Ztzel and his wife Pradel Eh
The rabbinic dynasty of Rabbi Ikutiel continued for 24 generations who sat on the throne of the rabbinate, and he was a student of Orachuti Haim Ztzel, the Radzin rabbi.
Rabbi Moshe Leib used to hang out with Wintzik, he didn't seek and didn't ask for any money, but sat day and night on the Torah and the work.
He studied in the home, in the synagogue and in the Radzine school
And together with the religious care for the city, the Torah did not leave his mouth
He was great in Torah and his knowledge in Shas and Fuskim was well known and famous
He authored important halacha and commentary books
He led his congregation with comfort and accompanied the entire life of his community with generosity and love, at the bitter end of the terrible destruction brought by Hitler and his associates.
Harodla excelled among Torah scholars and Jews

It was a very beautiful picture, especially on Shabbat and Yom-Tuv, in the schools
At the long tables sat Jews, dressed for the Sabbath, exempted from all
