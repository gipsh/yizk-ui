Do not stop shooting at the unfortunate
Here and there human bodies slide down and fall out, which were hit by the killers' bullets when they climbed onto the wagons.
I see a poor mother dragging her children and helping them get on the wagon, and in great panic she runs back to get the food package and the bottle of water that we took with us when we left Ochan.
Meanwhile, she saw a German assassin and pointed his revolver at her
Here I was more content and shouted to her: Mother! Escape! Save yourself! Hearing my screams, the killer turned his revolver on me and fired
But then a strange thing happened, next to me stood Pious (Eli' Idel's daughter) and she asked me to stop shouting
In pulling me I was forced to bend a little, and this happened just as the assassin fired, and the bullet flew through my head.
The German made a hand movement and my mother meanwhile got on the wagon
 


The wagons are locked, and the train moves slowly, and goes with our tormented and unfortunate dear ones on a road from which they have no longer returned, while our hardened and overwhelmed eyes accompany them with sorrow and pain. The whole night we sat on the packages - while the bodies of the victims who were killed in this murderous action were lying around us - and we wept and lamented the bitter fate and end of our dearest and the Harrodler Jews who were liquidated in a cruel and terrible way by the German bloodthirsty. .


The classification of the survivors on destruction and on work.


The morning after the terrible incident, a commission of murderers appeared, which once again classified those who remained, on the job.
