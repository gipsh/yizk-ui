Rabbi Haim Halevi Berman - (United States.


Remember what they did to us! Remember what Amalek did to you! Let's remember what Hitler did to us
Our Holy Torah commanded us not to forget, because it is in the nature of a people to forget, and people are in a position to forget even the atrocities and the terrible murder that the German murderers committed against the Jews in Poland and in other European countries. And among them our fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, not sparing the weak and sick, not even the children
Our Torah is called to us: write it down as a souvenir in a book


Because a book reminds and does not let you forget
Let's never forget, until the end of all generations
What the German Amalekites did to us! Let us not be influenced by the friendship and good will that the Germans show, the historical experience teaches us to remember and not to forget
The Jewish people have always recorded their troubles and misfortunes in their history of exile, Jeremiah the prophet wrote the book of Aicha on the great national calamity - the destruction of the Temple.
About the destruction of the two holy churches of Worms and Mainz, laments the Keena (which is included in the Tisha Bab Keenat): Hello, if my head were water and my eyes a liquid spring, I would cry all my days and nights.
In memory of the saints who allowed themselves to die for the sake of God in the years of Titnu-Titku, we say the Ab Harhamim prayer every Shabbat before the collection of prayers.
