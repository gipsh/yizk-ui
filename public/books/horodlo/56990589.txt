And if even the book of the Harodler community will not be able to believe with its quantity and number of pages to the reference books of other larger cities, then this book is dear to us, just as the Horodler community was dear to us.
The advantage of this small town was that it was closer to the hearts of its inhabitants because, due to their small number, one knew the other, and all the inhabitants of the town were like one big family.
I still remember the friendly relations and fraternal feelings of the Horodlers, that it was a joy for someone, all the Jews of the town rejoiced, and God forbid, on the contrary, in the case of someone's misfortune, all the residents mourned together.
 


The kindness of the Horodler Jews and their mutual and generous feelings were a thing of the past, and to this day, the Horodler locals who are spread over the world are distinguished by it. .
