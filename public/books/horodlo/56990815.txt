My hometown Haradla. .


It is a little difficult - after thirty years of absence - to write memories about Haradla and its Jews. And in truth, I would not write any memoirs at all if there were still Jewish Haradla. But the terrible destruction that happened to the European Jewry and the Polish Jews, in which six million Jews were murdered by the Jews, Hitler, and his murderers, among them the Haradler Jews: our parents, our brothers, our sisters. We are obliged to write memories about the town and its dear Jews. Let the following descriptions serve as words of remembrance for the Haradler community and its dear Jews, who were and are no longer there. .


The Haradler Jews in the month of Elul. The closer the month of Ab came to its end, one could feel in the holy air that the month of Elul was approaching. The Jews of Horodla pretend to be vigilant and sanctify themselves in the worship of the Bible. They get up early in the synagogue and in the Beit Midrash for Torah and prayer. In the evening, they hurry to leave their shops and their trade and rush into the shill, as they bring in the Torah and prayer in the night hours in the cities. When it approaches the time of forgiveness. The sanctity strengthens, and the atmosphere of forgiveness becomes ever more palpable and dominates the town. Works with whatever.
