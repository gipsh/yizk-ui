Horodla Expatriate Committee (Poland) in Israel.


Circular in the council of the Haradlers in Israel, and the committee in Buenos Aires (Argentina), decided to set up memorial creations, after the Haradler saints: our parents, sisters and brothers who were killed by the German murderers.
Among other proposals and decisions, it was decided to write a book of remembrance, which should give a picture of the Jewish life in Doradle in the past, and in the years of the last war and in the great catastrophe.
But already at the beginning of the work, we face a lack of documents of Haradler's life, a lack of pictures of people and events, which is the main material for such a work, we also do not have a list of the Jews who lived In Haradla close to the war, and also no news about their tragic end
That's why we turn to all readers, and ask them to send us material that can be used to create this book of remembrance, such as: Brion, documents, pictures, etc.
