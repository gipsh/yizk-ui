b) My dear parents: my father Levi Isaac Zavidovich, my mother Perl Zavidovich, their memory is blessed:


When I was very young, before Bar Mitzvah, my father Zel passed away and left my mother with small children who lost their teacher and guide. .


I was a small child at the time of his death. Of course, his dear figure stands before my eyes. I still remember his tall stature, his firm figure, his broad face that was covered with a blond beard, his high prominent forehead, and his kind-hearted and noble face. My father, Zel, distinguished himself with a boundless dedication to his family, to his wife (my mother and children), his love for us was a fatherly loyalty and at the same time with the determination of a teacher and guide. And we his children. .


My father was loved and respected by the Haradler Jews. He counted himself among the Radizner Hasidim of the Shtibel and was the permanent teacher of the Shtibel, his children were raised by my father Zel to Torah and reverence for God. Even in the most difficult times, when there was a lack of livelihood in our home, when.


He had to work hard to feed his wife and his five children, he did not want to allow my oldest brother Moshe Zalhid to help him in the family life. - The children need to learn and become Torah children - my father thought, therefore he considered paying the rabbi for tuition as one of his most important livelihood duties, even in the most difficult times, when he had no livelihood, he Make sure that the rabbi's tuition is paid on time. Our father was a great man of confidence and did not worry.
