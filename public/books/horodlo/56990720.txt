In the house I was lying in the shelter which was generally dark, but I could see the daylight and what was happening on the street.
Through a crack that was in the wall of the bar Heltenish, and I could hear the conversations of the peasants, and through that find out the news and the events, that's how I found out about the bitter end of my colleagues, the Unfortunate survivors who worked with me in the internship and who joined the Harur settlement and did not escape
When they got ready in the morning, they were taken to Hrubishov and they were killed (this was on January 10, 1942).
That's how I found out in a few weeks - that a number of colleagues also escaped that night from the good but they had no way to hide
These unfortunates wandered like abandoned animals, and no one was found who would take pity on them and provide them with a place of refuge.
Not only that: but the cruel gentiles handed them over to the Germans, after they found them hiding in the haystacks.
Among the impostors were several Jews from Strizhev, as well as three Horodlers: Fishel Shefak, his brother-in-law Mendel, Jacob Seidel
Jacob Seidel went through so many trials, suffered indescribable hardships during the war years and always escaped, at the last moment, from the danger of his life, he was betrayed by the Gentiles and was murdered.
Mirele Kapels was captured by Stach Schmitsky, who dragged her and handed her over to the Germans.
 


Two years in the house. The shelter in which I found myself for about two years was the largest of human beds. I was therefore forced to sit the whole time, because there was no place to sit. So I didn't talk to anyone the whole time and they didn't talk to me. The days and the nights went on slowly, and they got me.
