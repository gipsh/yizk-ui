Terung of new ways. In that period, they forced the Jews to remove the stone tombstones from the Jewish holy place and they used them to pave the road from Horodla to Stryjeun. After that.


When the tombstones were taken out, the farmers of the area brought the animals up to the destroyed cemetery to feed themselves. I also remember how the Germans turned the shed into a horse stable. Once, when it was a dead end, the Nazis forced the rabbi to arrange a funeral for the horse and bury him in a tallit at the Jewish cemetery.

A head of the congregation was then chosen who should be responsible towards the Germans and provide them with workers according to their demand, but the demands of the Germans were high and cruel and the head of the congregation did not have the ability and the will to fulfill them. Therefore, the Germans themselves used to raid the Jewish houses and catch Jews at work, and by the way they used to kill weak Jews and old people and anyone who did not like them. .


In one of these raids (in April 1942), in the early hours of the morning, my father Zal Ben Zion Fox was caught, along with four other Jews, and were murdered by the Nazis. Before the murder, the unfortunate ones were forced to dig their own graves. This situation of access, decrees and murders on the Jews continued until June 1942.

In one day, all the Jews from Haradla and the surrounding area were taken out of their houses, they were gathered together at a concentration place and all of them were taken to Munich. When the unfortunates arrived in Munich, they were all concentrated near the train station. We were told that from there we would be sent to various workplaces. .
