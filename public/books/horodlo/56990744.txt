dared to approach us, and we stepped back with great caution. In Svitlinsky's stable, we arranged it. But here too we were discovered by the owner of the stable. The thing happened like this: one day Shvitlinsky's wife was milking the cow in the barn while I was standing feeding her. - It seems you! Her husband answers. After his wife left the stable, Shvitlinsky stayed, and we hear him say to himself: - Yes, it smells like human excrement in the stable. We see how he is looking for the cause of it and he comes to the place where we did our needs. He went up to the attic of the stable and discovered us. We asked him not to make any noise and not to tell about us. We asked him to allow us to continue hiding here. In the morning he came up to us and told us that he had strange and sad dreams about us at night and asked us to leave. .


Once again we faced the problem of a shelter. This time we did not know where to go, and where to look for a hiding place. We entered the Christian cemetery, and we entered a burial cave of princes, after we broke open the door of the cave. We moved aside the two boxes with the dead, and we laid down there. We were only in the tomb cave for two days. We couldn't sow more there, because because of the bad and dirty air, we couldn't and didn't want to eat the food we had with us. We left the cave and we went to the manager of the priest's house to seek shelter. She suggested us to hide in the basement of the monastery, but we couldn't be there either, because at night vermin used to run around with flashing eyes that scared us again. .
