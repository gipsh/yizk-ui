The founders of the library themselves did not properly appreciate the great importance of the library, and of the activities surrounding it, for the formation of the youth and its organization for the Zionist idea as well as for its involvement in the Zionist work.

The public Zionist work that was organized for the first time by the Zionist Krain came to expression in the performance of a Hanukkah act that took place in the house of David Berger. I remember the good impression this act left on the youth. The program of the celebration was varied and interwoven with Hanukkah songs and declamations. The hall was decorated with Zion flags and with white and blue colors, and a high festive mood reigned in the city, and especially in the assembly hall which was packed with boys and girls. .


On this occasion, it is worthwhile to mention the first founders of the Zionist work in Horodla, who were: Ben-Zion Zuberman Zl, Fishel Zavidovich Zl, David Friend Zl. .


The Zionist activities as well as the cultural work have broadened and were conducted in an organized and orderly manner. At that time, the businessmen organized the first act of commemoration after Dr. Herzl - the founder of political Zionism. At the event, Zionist speeches were made by Zal Fishel Zavidovich, Zel Henech Zuberman, who left a strong impression on those gathered with their rich content and with their successful form. .


In a period of time, the work was organized for the Zionist funds: the foundation for the rise of Israel and the foundation, and they were angry.
