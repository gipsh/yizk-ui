Rabbi Mattihu (Mathes), the Dredki teacher. Dedicated to his holy memory).


Not like all the teachers, our Dredki teacher was. All those who had no income became teachers, and the parents handed over the children to them, so that they could teach the little children the Torah. In different ways, the teachers used to fulfill their mission, some with a cane, and some with a simple stick, and so the children used to absorb the Torah and Klep simultaneously. Our rabbi, like the other teachers, did not withhold his staff from us, but his way of teaching was completely different, because he acquired his profession thanks to his experience of work and teaching and he was very skilled in his profession. .


Our rabbi began his work as a mentor of teachers in the cities of Galicia, and there he received the training to become teachers just like the teachers in our time. He had diplomas, recommendations and awards in his teaching field. We really liked the study with the explanation of the holy language in Yiddish. The rabbi knew how to make the lesson enjoyable for us, he understood us and brought us closer to his Torah. And so he had the privilege of standing up scholars who used to argue with him and say to their children: Go my son, go to Rabbi Mates! I, your father, also studied with him, and in this love lay all his greatness. .


In general, he was a cheerful person, understanding and wise, good natured and happy in his lot. He was able to gain the love of all classes of our city: both the scholars and the common people.
