When night fell, we got up and went to the village of Ribene (3 km from Haradla). We knocked on the door of a poor farmer, and after agreeing and promising him that we would give him favors and bring him many things during the night, he let us go up to the attic of the stable and hide. .


At night, we used to come out of our hiding place, and used to drag out chickens from the farmers of the area, also potatoes, and even grain kernels and we used to bring all this to our farmer, which made us appreciate it more and more, and even made us Boiled down chatter. The farmer showed extraordinary caution. Even his family members did not know about .


Us. .


We stayed with this farmer until the month of May, and then we went out into the fields to seek shelter. We went to the fields of Stashin - in the farm where we worked at first. We met the field keeper and we informed him that he should pretend not to see our presence. And if he will not show any understanding, we will liquidate him. We told him that we belong to a partisan society that numbers 500 people. The guard really behaved as it should be. We dragged food out of the farm, we even went into the stables and milked the cows, and we roamed the wide fields. We were hiding in the fields for two months. .


We then met a gen, who told us that a Jew was hiding, just like us, close to us, and that he wanted to see us, and indeed at night Velvele Strijever appeared with a gun and joined us. . Our confidence has increased a little. Our incursions into the peasant farms became a serious terror, and the food we collected was of a sufficient amount.
