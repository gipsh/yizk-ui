After the murder of the survivors, a few days after the deportation, the Germans took out Rachel Blat, Avraham Seidel (the son of Rebecca Seidel) and Moshe Berger, took them to the Jewish cemetery and murdered them. .


A few days later, the Germans sent Haim Weintroib with a letter to the village of Mach, and killed him there. Two days later, the murderers also sent Abraham - the son of Toibelen - with a similar letter to the village of Mach. When we told him to try to escape and hide, he replied: Where should I run and where should I hide, anyway I won't be able to escape and what needs to happen will happen anyway. .


At the same time, they also killed Shmuel (Smulka), the rabbi's son, and buried him in the Polish school. .


A fear and a fear and the lack of personal security reigned in every corner. Even our own shadow cast fear upon us. .


The Lord Adler exiles in the city of Okhan, about a week ago, I found out that my mother and the children, together with the Horodler Jews, are in Okhan. We also heard about the terrible mass murder of the Okhan Jews. We were told that the Germans took many Jews out of Ochan, burned them at the Jewish cemetery and shot them there, among the dead were also twenty-two Horodler Jews. From among those who were led to death, only two remained, who were employed in burying the victims. They were: Jacob Seidel (Yankele, Rebecca Seidel's son), and Matel Sofris son-in-law (Rishle's husband). Their description of the barbaric murder that the Germans carried out hardened the blood. .
