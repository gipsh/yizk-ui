My brother Hen Zal, whose education level was already high and the political currents of the world were known to him, and he explained to me the political meaning of the song (I think he also invited me to sing it) and also recognized the leftist tendency of the circle that gathered around the library, my brother Henen saw in this group a danger for the youth from a national point of view
Therefore, he called all the best youth together with the existing library crane, and a large general library was established there.
The biggest difficulty in establishing the library was the problem of a suitable apartment for the same, our parents were religious zealots and have already taken care that no one should rent us his apartment, or a room for our activity.
The combination of boys and girls coming together at meetings and gatherings was then considered a great sin, and not once did it happen that parents used to enter the meetings and force their daughters to go home.
Despite this, we continued our work and we even made progress
We then got a room at Rachel Berger's
I remember the first general meeting that took place in our little club
What great preparations for the first assembly! How great was the general interest! A festive mood reigned in the evening of the meeting, which chose a director to lead the library.
And the cultural work
My brother Hanen Zel (as chairman), one of the sisters Stow (as vice-chairman) were elected in the leadership.
Mordechai Zuberman (secretary) and Shlomo Zuberman (cashier)
 


Twice a week the library was open to take out books. Almost every evening people gathered to chat and read. Friday night and Saturday afternoon, lectures and conversations about different social problems took place in the club.
