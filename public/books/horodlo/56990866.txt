We were separated from our parents. We saw everything. Before our eyes, half of them were soon killed. We were silent, only gritting our teeth. .


A dark train soon arrived. - Why did this happen to us! The mother and the children were taken out there and the train started to leave. .


Oh, woe is to my life! I was left alone like a rock. I could not believe that I would never see my mother again. .


Alone, alone, we were now left without father, mother, without a home: we were driven to hard work. We no longer have any strength to walk around. .


A star fell from the sky and pierced the earth like this... The crown of the Jewish daughters that adorned us so beautifully was removed. .


But after the work - what happens now? The murderer also calls us to shoot. .
