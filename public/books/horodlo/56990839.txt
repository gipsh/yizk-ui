The Sabbath prayers.


Whoever wants to know what Shabbat is, its importance, its essence, should turn a page in this Siddur and read into his prayers, because in them he will find the soul of the nation and the soul of the Sabbath. From this exalted poetry, which easily emerges from the black fire of its letters, he will absorb the people's spirit, he will listen to the beating of his heart, he will fill out the depth of his soul. .


He will convince himself that on the Sabbath only the body rests, but not the spirit, the soul and the heart. They work on the Sabbath, awakening aspirations, longings, love, memories, blessings, and all this from the elevation of the soul. happy rest Holiness... .


You welcome the Sabbath with love, with singing. Ashira that flows out of love and a love that flows from poetry. That's why the opening of the talk on Shabbat evening is by the presenter: the Song of Songs, a song of praise between the Knesset of Israel and the Holy One, blessed be He. And the love is so strong in the heart of the Jew, until he goes over to your friend's soul and then it splits up so much that your soul is sick of your love. My soul is sick of your love, and he longs to see the splendor of his strength. After the love corridor, powder room, the person enters the lounge, the hall, of the prayer: Lecho Narnana, the soul outpouring of the Naim Zimirot Yisrael flows out of his mouth through some chapters of Psalms. Until he feels great joy. The joy.
