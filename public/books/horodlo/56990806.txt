Haradla was a small town, and its pride with its great rabbi was very great, the spiritual influence of the rabbi on his congregation was great and visible and with his Torah greatness the whole city was proud. He was revered by everyone and everyone listened to his words and his Torah. .


Z) My father Reverend Moshe Mendel Wallach: in the town he was simply called: Rabbi Moshe Mendel. Although he was known as a scholar, he associated with simple righteous people, and in his daily life he conducted himself with simplicity and humility. He was an excellent family man, and he loved his home with a noble love, his relationship to my mother was full of honor and respect, as was the case with pious Jews, he did not call my mother by I name, but despite this, there was complete understanding and mutual respect between them, I don't remember my father when he raised his voice and got angry in our house, his relationship with his daughters - my sisters, was a fatherly relationship. Full of magnanimity. .

In these chilling and emotional moments, without drawing attention, he called me into his room with a wink, put his hands on my head and blessed me in silence. His tears that fell on my cat affected me.
