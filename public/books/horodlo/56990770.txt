And now the world looks on as they lead to the slaughter of innocent masses, and it also shines. The sun has warmed more and more with its rays as if it had made them strong, and they warm the thirsty camp, which throws off a garment after A garment, in order to lighten their fineness and their beauty. .


Here we meet a small group of tired and broken Jews, returning from a journey similar to ours. These people are a small part of a Jewish camp that was led to extermination, but they were chosen for work and were temporarily saved. Run away! Run away! Do not go in the direction that you are being led! They shout at us, but how and where do people run away, when all the roads are closed and the Gentiles watch the Jews' steps, and hand over the runaways to the Germans, and the journey begins...


The lunch hours have arrived. The sky is covered with clouds and a strong wind chases almost no waves, and begins to shake and storm the world. It has been shown that the forces of nature have come to the aid of the suffering thirsty people in order to alleviate their thirst. The wind strengthens and turns into a storm, clouds of dust and sand begin to cover the sky, one does not see the other, one hears exclamations and screams. The horses try to get out of their harness and do not follow their masters. The mother and I put our arms around the children so that the wind does not separate them. .


A hopeful thought arises: perhaps the storm will separate us from the German murderers, but when the storm is over we are convinced that we are still in the hands of our enemies. The night descended. We arrive at the station called Munchin, somewhere near Zamosc, darkness all around. Our feet are soaking in the deep mud, our clothes are.
