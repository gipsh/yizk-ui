Their persecution of the Polish Jews
The waves of hatred rose and intensified, and the entire attention of the Poles was concentrated so far that they did not feel the coming war.
What it prepares for their great historical enemy
The enmity of the Poles towards the Jews assumed ever stronger forms and became dangerous for the Jews
The general atmosphere is what once became tighter to the point of being unbearable
The Poles began to defame the Jews and talked about them as a foreign element in the country and especially in the Polish economy.
The leaders and government officials did not stop talking about the Jewish question that demands a solution
The economic oppression became stronger, anti-Jewish laws were issued from time to time, and the possibility of economic existence of the Polish Jews became smaller and smaller.
Many Jews in Poland were shocked by the newly created situation, and used to ask themselves: can they consider the Polish country - as they lived for hundreds of years as a safe home for the future?
 


The hatred of the Jews, which became stronger and stronger, also led to the strengthening of the Zionist and social activity, which encompassed more and more the Jewish masses in Poland. The urge to immigrate to the Land of Israel and emigrate to other safe countries took on a mass character and encompassed almost all of Horodler's youth. Even the Yenikas who previously believed that the newly created situation was temporary, began to doubt it and began to think about emigrating, or about leaving the small town of Horodla, and moving to other larger cities with larger Jewish communities. In those years, the number of immigrants to Israel and the number of emigrants in the countries of North and South America increased. .
