The hole through which we used to go out and in. And along with the bunch of hay, the revolver with our fosky slipped out. They immediately ran to the commander to tell about the case. We immediately ran away, and we ran into the fields in the direction of Murchak's brick kiln, we turned around in the fields and we didn't know what to do. In the distance, we saw a farmer with a wagon drawn by two horses, who was plowing the field. We approached him, and we recognized Dumek Amandrich in him, who greeted us and said to us: Boys, hold fast, because the German defeat in Am is very close. The guy told us war news and about the destruction of the German army, news that made us feel a little different. .


We were on the field until the evening, at night we left to try to find a hiding place with a guy named Michielka Kaschak. We told him that the war would soon end with the defeat of the Germans, and we would know how to reward him for his agreement to hide in the attic of his house. We convinced him and he also agreed. .


This shelter was our last shelter. After a long period of a life of fineness and motherhood, a period of life in which we were hunted like animals. A few weeks have passed, and we saw from our hiding place an unusual military movement that was outside the normal framework, and a lot of troops with uniforms unknown to us are coming from the eastern side of the river, and the Gentiles appear in our hiding and announcing that the Russian army had captured Haradle and that the Germans had been defeated. We came out of our hiding place, and for the first time - after such a long and painful period - we saw ourselves out on the street in the middle of the day. We were lonely and unhappy. Everything seemed strange and depressing. - Where are you, Horadler?
