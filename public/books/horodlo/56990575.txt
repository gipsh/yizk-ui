The commission also expresses its recognition of the Harodler Helpers Association in Argentina, for collecting materials, for writing memoirs and for the presentation of the list of the saints.


When publishing the reference book, we need to emphasize that we cannot say that our work is accurate and clean of errors and errors. However, we have done what we could to limit as far as possible the errors and mistakes that are a result of the conditions that have arisen due to time and geographical distance, and we have tried to give a picture. From the life of the Horodlar community, which suffered so much and fell by the gray hand of the bloody enemy. May this book serve as an eternal memory and as a testimony to the holy community of Harodla! .
