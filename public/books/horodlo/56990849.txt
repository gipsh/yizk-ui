Rachel Zuberman Bergman - (Argentina).


A reminder about my family. I want to convey here memories from my earlier childhood, about my grandfather Joel Iche Zuberman, with his sons, daughters, sons, sons-in-law and grandchildren. .


I was four years old at the time, my grandfather Yuel Iche and my grandmother, Hanna Reizel, lived in Lishkev in a large, comfortable apartment, they had granaries for grain. My grandfather had a lot of fields, but he didn't work there, the grandfather was foraging in the nearby forests and used to come home only on Saturday. When the grandfather came home, we, all the grandchildren, surrounded him and were very happy. The grandfather gave us a pinch on the cheek and used to make us laugh. The grandfather studied Torah for a whole Shabbat. He was a scholar, moreover, a good-hearted person. The grandmother was also a loving mother to everyone, they had 10 children: 5 sons and 5 daughters. The voice of the Talmud always sounded in their home. The best teachers were considered, there were also teachers. All the children could study well. Even the aunts could learn. The house was immersed in learning. The grandfather and the sons were Hasidic of Radzin, hit the uncle Jaske, who was a Hasidic of Trisker. .


The oldest of the children was Aunt Haya. She lived with her family in Vyslevich, later in Helm. She had five children. One son lives in North America. The rest were killed by the murderers. .


The second was Joske, David Joseph Zuberman. His wife was Ribche, David Nette Moshe's daughter, they had seven children. Only.
