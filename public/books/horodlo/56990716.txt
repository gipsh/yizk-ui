Able and weak. The laborers - among whom I was also - were sent back to Ochan, while the weak ones were transferred to the concentration camp in Stow (near Helem). It was a terrible camp, the unfortunates walked around the camp naked, just like they were born. About the horrors of the camp, we were informed by Jacob Seidel, who was also among the unfortunates who were transferred to Stow, and who appeared to escape from the camp and unite with us. Together with Yaakov Seidel in escaping from the camp, Ichele - a grandson of Moshe Boymayil, the eldest of the camp - who was a Ukrainian murderer - realized that they had escaped, and while chasing them, he caught Ichelen, returned him to the camp and hung him up in front of the arrested. .


When we arrived in Ochan, I entered the house as my mother and the children used to while they were in Ochan. In this room I found souvenirs of my dearest ones, which moved my heart. Here lies the little hat of my younger sister. In a corner are the reading glasses of my mother, and the arrangement with the yellowed leaves of my mother's tears, here is the bundle of wood for baking and cooking, which my mother gathered in the forest, and brought it into the house, setting her life . I no longer had any strength in view of the souvenirs that reminded me of the beauty of my family, and I fell into weakness. I don't know how long I lay unconscious, but when I came to I found myself hugging the bundle of wood. .


The remaining Horodlers were returned from Ochan to Horodla, and from there we were taken to work in the good station. There we found a number of Jews from the village of Strijeun as well as some Jews who appeared to have escaped from the Warsaw ghetto. .
