Getting a piece of bread occupied the thoughts of the ghetto resident and didn't give a damn while we stood for the last time in the ghetto market, and we waited for the order to move on our final way. .


A fleeting murmur broke the general silence. - Here they come!, one told the other, and immediately one could see a number of German killers, racing on their horses, with clubs in their hands. A cold sweat broke out at the sight of their murderous faces. .


My mother gathered her children and wrapped them in her arms, as if she wanted to protect them from the coming evil. And we, the children, pressed ourselves to the mother, and we hid one behind the other, just like the little ones that curl around their faithful posts in the sight of snarling wolves. - Up on the stove! Cut the silence of the camp by an order. With a terrible silence and submission, everyone fulfills the order and goes up on the furn. The peasant drivers throw their whips and the horses go forward. - Where? ! Everyone knows the direction, but people do not dare to speak the truth and to reveal this cruel idea. For a long time, we were not allowed to sit on the wagons, because on the way the foreman ordered us to get off the wagons, so as not to tire the horses, and the crowd, oppressed, hungry and thirsty, dragged themselves in the direction of extinction. . .


I cast a glance at the camp of the displaced, which looks in my eyes like a camp of the dead who have just risen from their graves, to which they must soon return, but, even in these last moments of joy, the spirit of life awakens. Urges and ignites hidden hopes. -- Maybe something will happen soon and we will run away, a hopeful thought sneaks up, and by the way, you start to look at the sky and a roar of Shema Yisrael breaks out in anticipation of an answer. .
