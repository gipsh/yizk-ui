This escape
At the end of the work season, the economic director came one day, riding his horse, called me aside, and told me that he had received an order from the Germans to place the Jews in the German Command tomorrow. who work for him
I asked him if I could leave work in the middle of the day, and he said yes
I went to the farm, to the place where the Jewish workers gathered to eat and I told them the news.
I told them that according to my opinion we should escape from here at night, Uncle Ali and his sons answered me that they no longer had the strength to move, and let whatever happened happen, I agreed with My brothers and I tend to run away at night
We prepared bread and other food and at night we escaped from the economy
We went out into the fields and headed for the village of Yanki, three kilometers from Haradle
We arrived in the village and we left in the area of the stables
In the darkness of the night, in the silence, we entered a barn that was full of hay, and that belonged to a well-known farmer of ours.
We buried ourselves in the hay and we lay quietly, at night we used to go outside, but during the day we lay in our hiding place in the hay stables and we were very careful not to be discovered.
 


When we used to go out at night to look for water and food, we used to wipe our steps when returning to the stable. We hoped that we would be able to win here for a long time, and that we would not be discovered. .


Once the Puerte's daughter noticed footprints that led to the stable attic, she followed the steps up to the attic and discovered us, at first she was very scared, because she stepped on someone's face with her foot.
