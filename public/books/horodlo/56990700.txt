But the German murderers had no mercy on these unfortunate few either. When they arrived in Belzitz, they told the Germans that they could drink water from the city well, and when the unfortunate people gathered around the well to quench their thirst, the killers opened fire on them and killed them all. .


This mass mausoleum cast a heavy burden on the Jews, and a great lamentation enveloped us all. The Jews of all the neighboring cities sat down and lamented the destruction that the Germans had caused. .


A panic and an escape This murder caused a great panic on the Jewish street of our city. Everyone was convinced that remaining under the Germans meant destruction. The Horodler Jews wanted to escape to the Russian side and were also looking for ways. But it was already too late. A small number of Jews - among them was also my father Nette Perlmutter - appeared to cross the river. Gentiles have buried them in their slopes for a large sum of money. .


Unfortunately, this rescue operation also ended with a terrible tragedy. Many Jews were looking for different ways to cross the border. Moreover, they paid a lot of money to Gentiles who had slopes so that they could move the bow. These gentiles took advantage of the trouble of the unfortunate, and when they found themselves in the middle of the river, they overturned the slopes with the fleeing ones, some of them drowned and their bodies were found on the river. The escape ended, and the majority of the inhabitants, who did not attempt to escape, remained in Horodla with the Germans. .
