turned out to be infinite. In winter, I was very cold in my bedroom, so that the water that was in a vessel next to the bed froze. On the other hand, in the summer, a stifling heat prevailed in my shelter. The frequent searches that the Germans carried out robbed me of my peace. The fear of the searches completely oppressed me. I stopped eating. And I became thinner from day to day until I became completely emaciated, a sadness gripped me and I wept without ceasing, at the same time in the fate of my mother and my younger brothers and sisters, and in the fate of The Jews in general. The terrible events did not leave my memory, and all the terrible images and all the black events were always in front of my eyes.


Now I remember the horrible night in Munich. I see my mother trying in vain to reach her poor bundles and bring them onto the wagon. And just as the Germans are shooting on all sides and she is already exhausted and is forced to leave them behind, Fluzim asks my younger brother Yosele: Mom! Where are my Tefillin? And when he heard that the tefillin were left in the packages, Yasela rushes out to the packages, finds the tefillin, puts them inside his clothes adding a saying from Kiddush Hashem: - If I will still be alive tomorrow morning, If I need to lay tefillin, and he proved that he correctly assesses the situation. How dear the tefillin were to him! And how strong was his love for them! This is understandable, because he became Bar Mitzvah the previous Passover. .


In grief and in hostile thoughts, I pass a hopeless year in my shelter. The year 1943 arrived and with it important news. It was learned that the German army is withdrawing from Russian soil. Thus a large camp of the retreating German army arrived in Horodla and prepared to occupy a position on the border line along the river Bug. For me, the situation became worse, the Germans.
