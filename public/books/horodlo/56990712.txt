The Nirus of the last ones left to Okhan eight days after Shavuot (in the year 1942), after completing the plani language work among the farmers, we, the young ones, were also expelled from Horodla, and we were taken to Okhan. We were chased for a break until Oban. How happy I was when I met my mother, brother and sister again in Ochan. .


The children of Nette Fereltuter, how happy I was to see how they run to me with pale faces and take me around and cry. Great was my luck, that I brought them in the cart that followed us and that brought the packs of the displaced, a pile of potatoes and wood for the heat that I received from the farmer Budniewski on account of the sheep that we sold him , with the promise that the rest that comes to us, he will send to us when we will write to him about our new residence. .
