Hunger and diseases The hunger and the lack brought the typhoid disease, which spread and almost did not pass through a single Jewish home. The city doctor was forbidden to visit the Jewish sick. There was also a danger to announce about the illness of a Jew, otherwise the Germans would find out. Due to the lack of medical treatment, Sarah Ite's husband and son died of typhus.
