A word from the publisher after a lot of effort and effort that has been invested in the collection of material, in its work and in the preparation for printing, we add to all the horodlers, as they may not be found, as well as to all the who are interested in the erection of a monument to Polish Jewry, this memorial to the Holy Church of Harodla, which was destroyed, together with Polish Jewry, by the German Nazis yesterday, in the great European holocaust, in the Second World - War
It was decided to publish this book: the Horodla Committee of Israel, the Horodlar Association of the United States, and the Horodlar Aid Association in Argentina, wanting to erect an eternal monument to the saints of Horodla, who were killed by the Germans. murderers and their associates, not knowing where their grave is and where their sacred building rests
More than five years have passed, from the day we published the first letter to the Harrodler Landslime, in which we informed them about our decision to publish a memorial book, and we asked them to provide us with articles, memories, pictures of The Horodlar saints, and other material that has a relationship with Horodla
Little by little and with big breaks, the material arrived, which was worked on by us and prepared for printing
Written documents about the life of the Jews of Harodla, as well as other documentary materials of the local community, did not remain after the Holocaust.
We were therefore forced to content ourselves with the memoirs and accounts that were written by the Harodlar landslight, after many years of absence from Horodla, and after a long time since the events described by them.
