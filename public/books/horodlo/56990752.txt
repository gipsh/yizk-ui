And they led us to Munich, tired and broken, the deportees went, accompanied by our side by the German killers who were riding their horses. When we arrived in Munich, we saw how we were led into a storage room surrounded by wires. Entering the stable was accompanied by torture. German soldiers stood on both sides of the entrance and beat the incoming people with murderous blows. .


At dusk, on the same day, in the evening, the Germans forcibly took out the women and children by force, put them on cargo wagons from a train that took them to Belushits - the horrible extermination camp, and from there They no longer came back. It is difficult to describe the terrible horror and the cruelty of the murderers when separating the families. A bitter day, a black one that day, and the whole camp was shocked and was broken. The night descended. Each one of us lay in his place full of shivers and fear, which stole the sleep from our eyes. .


The next morning, a German commissioner appeared with a gang of murderers, and after a short consultation with the Germans who had accompanied us to Munich, they sat down at the table at the entrance to the second production hall, which we had not noticed until then - And they began to classify the survivors (the men remained, because the women and the children were no longer there). Each of us crossed the stable through two rows of soldiers, the classification commission. The young people were transferred to the right, and the old and weak - to the left and they were led into a closed place. On the side of the young, they also transferred the Judenrat. .


After finishing the classification, we were several hundred young people. The Germans informed us that we would return.
