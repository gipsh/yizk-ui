Homes and from their city, where they have lived for generations, are led tired and broken in an unknown direction
I remember how my mother and her children - her swallows - left our home
And when they were already far away from the house, my mother turned her head to the side of the house, sighed and said: Do you know if I will see my house again?
I was among those who managed to get a job site, and because of that I stayed in the city
I hoped that I would be able to provide my mother with food after the nature of their deportation became known.
And when I said goodbye to my loved ones, it appeared to me that my heart had been moved from its place
I stood with a frozen look, and looked after my mother and my sisters, who became more and more distant all the time.


I returned from the empty market and I cried out loud
I wouldn't mind if the Germans hear my cry and kill me, I went I arrived at our home
But they didn't let me enter our house anymore
A Christian named Najali stood by the door and said to me: - What do you want here? From now on in my house and you have no right to enter
We, the survivors, asked to be given a house to cry in, and we got such a house.
All the Jewish houses were occupied by Christians, a large number of houses were disturbed by their occupants and the material was transferred to them.
The town streets have changed with a terrifying change
It seemed that the city and its streets were mourning the destruction
I look to the side of our house, consider the trees that were planted by my brother, and I see how they have bloomed and are covered with spring flowers.


My heart sank at their sight
A fear and dread in every corner
We were afraid to be in our town
