Horodla did not have any power. The Foliaks left the city and retreated to the eastern side of the Bug and the Germans were somewhere on the western side of the city and did not enter the city yet, but Hormats fired at Horodla, to the eastern bank of the Bug. . This was before Rosh Hashanah, and I decided to get some vegetables and fruit in honor of Yom Tov. I settled on Pilsudski Street, because it was won by farmers who had green-leaved gardeners and Seder. I continued my walk until the Polish school.


And a mighty array of motorized forces appeared in the air. A large number of German tanks appeared in front of my eyes, which are moving towards the city. A loud exclamation caught my ear, and I instinctively let myself run to a shelter, and after gathering there for a while, I crept home through the vegetable gardens that spread on the north side of Pilsudski Street. . I still managed to see the German army marching into the broad market of Horodla. .
