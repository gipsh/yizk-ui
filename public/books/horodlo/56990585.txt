The charity that you have was always extended to the poor woman who feared God, Martha Rabkah Ehsh Hid, a granddaughter of the famous rabbi and tzaddik, Admur Kadosh Elion Maharam of Kabrin Ztlaha? .


Here are the butchers of our city, the tzaddikim and hasidim, those who engaged in the faith of Solomon with their holy work, the holy Tam Visher Mohr Jacob Chesner, and the second one who was similar to him, the young in years but old in wisdom and Torah, the holy Mohar Mordechai the priest Feigenbaum their memory is blessed. Hand? ! Where are all the pious and innocent Hasidic, the Lumdei Hora and Mitzvot Observers?! Where are the ordinary owners of houses and all ordinary Jews! What were all important in our city? ! All of them came here, away from the world. May the bright memory of the Horadler saints be praised, sanctified and blessed forever! We pray to the Almighty for the under the wings of the Shekinah of all the holy and pure of the Jewish community of Horodla, together with the souls of all the holy and pure, who were murdered, burned, drowned and tortured, the Infants from their mother's lap. - May they be in heaven, blessed by the resurrection of the dead.


By the way, the lives of their souls! To eternal disgrace and shame should be the murderer nation! Cursed be the German Nazi nation, in his name, from among the nations, to the city may he be for all eternity! Cursed from all parts of the earth in the earth that absorbed the blood of our dearest and dearest! Woe to the nations with merciless hearts, who knew well what was being done to us and remained silent, while they could have saved tens and hundreds of thousands of lives and they did not. Night: They closed the gates of their lands for the refugee camp, which barely escaped. Woe to you, man, because you did not protect them from their destroyers! Woe to you, humanity, because with your obstinate silence and cruel fascism, you have become a partner of the German Nazi EMLK, Imach Shmu! Woe to you, hard-hearted humanity, that you watched.
