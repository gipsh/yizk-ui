We left the church basement. We remembered the abandoned ruin that belonged to the farmer Kublokha, where no people come, the summer has arrived, the days were already hot, and we thought that the ruin would be suitable for a shelter for the summer. .


We hid in the ruins and we thought that no one would discover us here, but we were discovered here too by a sudden accident: Golamboski lived near the ruins, and he got lost going there.
Golamboski called Kablacha's granddaughter to go up to the attic of the ruins and see if the dog was there. When she went up to the attic and saw us, she became very frightened and let out a fearful squeal and ran back in great fear.
Kablokha got up to see what had startled her so much, I jumped on him and calmed him down.
I told him that we were only hiding here, and we asked him not to make any noise
He went back down, and told the neighbors - who gathered at the girl's screams, that nothing special happened here, after the neighbors went away, he went up to us, and took some hair from us. From our head, he set them on the fire, and named his grandson to stick their smell (without superstition, to take the fear of a people who was overwhelmed)
 


In the evening the farmer came up to us and told us. so that we can hide in his stable, and for that he demanded from us to bring him stolen things, during the nights we wandered around and looked for possibilities of providing stolen things for our welfare, and we used to bring him various things: flour, grain, clothes, and even a calf, while he used to prepare food for us and bring it to our shelter. His wife didn't know about us at all, and neither did Kablakha.
