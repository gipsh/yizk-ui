Lots of memorial pages and memorial books, which should tell generations of what the German murderers did to the Jewish people and how millions of innocent and dear Jews were destroyed. Souvenir books that should describe the modest life of these Jews, their behavior in the weaving and on holidays, the weekly and the spiritual life of the great and invested Jewry that was destroyed in such a cruel way. Among the memorial books in memory of the holy churches, which are written by the descendants of the cities and towns of Poland, Lithuania, Chebia and other countries, the memorial book of Horodla will occupy an honorable place, and will serve as a tombstone after Our dear ones, the saints and martyrs, who were innocently killed by the barbaric Germans and their helpers, in a cruel and terrible way. .
