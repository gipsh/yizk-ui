Joseph Ari Herbst - (Argentina) (Reminiscences of the not-so-distant past.


Was once a Jewish life full of content and beauty! I say this not only because of romantic demand for the past, as it often happens with people who start to look into the distant past, but in view of today's life, and making an objective comparison with what was in the spring of Our own life, the past grows to great heights. Then our parents, their daily deeds, their Shabbat holidays, their chastity and charity came out. So you get caught up in your memories about them, and you begin to understand their beauty in their way of life, and their nobility in their Judaism. Yes, my friends, this is more than romanticizing the past, this is only a sober assessment of a vanished era, with the perspective of time. With the benefit of years of life experience, and in the prism of today's reality. .


My father, R. Shmuel Herbst Zel, was a dear you, a warm Radzine Hasidic, an enthusiastic master of prayer, whose songs were sung, my mother, Toibe Zel, was a righteous woman, known in our town for being very wise Woman, she was the real wife of bravery, who took care of our home, she was a modest woman, a pious person who did not miss to pray all day. As I said, my father was a Radzin Hasidic, from the prominent family of the rabbi, and like the gentleman, he used to travel to Warsaw to see him. Over to the good times. .
