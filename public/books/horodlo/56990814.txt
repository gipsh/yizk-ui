Returning to the town, they arrived at night, so that the people of the town would not notice them. Entering the house, the rabbi said: Oh, Moshe, Moshe. You spent your money and your time and everything on my fault. I forgot to tell you before our trip about a dream I had about a bookcase I received. I have to continue to be a teacher, and continue to make our sons good kosher Jews. I will never succeed as a merchant, because teaching is my mission forever, and you, Moshe. Forgive me for the damage I caused you. .


And so the rabbi returned to teaching, and continued to do so throughout his life, and he died as a teacher in our small town in Poland. May his memory be blessed! .


His disciple Barg in Israel. .
