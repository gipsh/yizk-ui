They confiscated all the farms of the farmers, including the farm in which I was hiding. At night I huddled together and I exerted all my strength not to fall asleep so that the Germans who slept in the same barn would not find out about my presence. I had to be careful with the slightest movement. .


The danger of discovering me was now greater, because the horses of the German army grazed and ate from the hay that lay on my hideout and hid me. The farmer Budniewski saw that until the next harvest, the horses would eat all the hay, so he started to cut off green hay to cover the flat of my hideout. This caused curiosity among his neighbors earlier. .


In the last weeks before the liberation, I felt that my strength was running out and my strength of resistance was coming to an end. The front is thundering, there are fires and explosions. A bomb falls on a house and it goes away with the smoke. A great panic is felt outside and the farmers are running around here and there, the farmer Budniewski is preparing an emergency exit for my shelter, I should be able to escape through it in case of a fire. While I felt that my legs could no longer carry me, and certainly could not run. I can no longer hold on to the feat. .


And now the Germans are running and pulling back, they have already crossed the bow to the west and they are leaving big fires under themselves, as is their custom when retreating. An order was issued to the residents that they must leave Horodla. Farmers pack their bags, a great noise and a panic all around, what will I do myself, if the farmers family - my welfare - will be forced to leave the city? The sound of the gunfire and of the bombs exploding gets stronger every now and then, and I also hear the panicked running of the Germans. .
