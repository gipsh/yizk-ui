c) Gittel Mederdrut (Gittel Isr's) a pious woman of many good deeds. A woman who strove to do charity and good. She observed a number of charity mitzvot in a definite way. Every Friday and the eve of Yom Tov, they used to go over the Jewish pillars and collect candles to light them in the shells, and she also collected charity to give Matan Baster, and she used to be well received in every Jewish home. Everyone appreciated her charity and even the poorest used to give her their charity. About the kindness of the Haradler Jews, Rebecca Medderdrot tells: that when she used to visit the Jewish houses to collect challah and bread for the poor of the town, she naturally wanted to avoid the hardships of the poor. Used to be the last to come to the house. With a challah in his hand, with a claim: Why are you avoiding my house Rebecca! My house is also a Jewish home and I also want to give charity. And they used to leave their donation with me. .
