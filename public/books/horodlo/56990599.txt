The Great Synagogue.


During these days, most of the Jews of the town prayed, and which also served as a center of Torah and prayer and as the site of the social life of the town. With all their busyness and rush for livelihood, the Horodler Jews found time for Torah in public prayer in the synagogue. From quite early on, the Horadler Jews used to flock to the synagogue. They pray at dawn, and in the evening they gather again for Mencha Mearib, and after that they used to sit around the long wooden tables to study a page of Talmud, Mishniyot, Ein Ya'akov or Parashat HaShavu, and after studying they used to talk to each other about livelihood or About today's events. .
