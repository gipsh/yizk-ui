Will I have to pay back my debt?, and I don't have any money to spare at home. .


This is how it happened that this young man Yitzchak Saler, who had never done anything bad, a weak man who did not even bother a fly on the wall, who suffered hardship and hunger and kept silent so that people in the town would not know. How great is his need, who never wanted to take any favors, the one whom everyone called Isaac Han, a man who did not mix with people and was not interested in politics and the other issues that occur around him. , this man was able to show in his last hour an exalted bravery and courage that was unheard of
At the outbreak of the war in the year 1939, when the Nazi boot stepped on Poland and also arrived in our town of Horadla, our Isaac's situation was very bad.
He was resigned and hopeless, it hit him like thunder in broad daylight.
He didn't have any money in his pocket, to deal with what is not, obviously the Nazis didn't allow it in those days, he walked around locked in himself and said: - And what will happen to us now? How will we get out of this trouble? Trade, the Germans will certainly not be paid and to earn to live will certainly not be fun, and where will I get food for the children? - He still could not imagine that the Nazis would not only demand the money of the Jew but the most precious thing that a person has: his life.
And so he used to ask his wife, when he saw that there are still people who leave the town: - Well, Hashe! What are you doing now? Where are you running away to? True, we still have two hundred kilos of barley and some tobacco, but how long will we be able to survive on it? - And what will we do so that this will end?
