New war - break with Russia After the outbreak of the war with the Russians (June 1941) a new decree was issued that everyone must show that he is connected to a workplace at a Christian farmer, who will do this Not being able to show up means getting kicked out of town. The Jews ran to the farmers and asked them to take them to work, and to give them a fair amount of work for a proper payment. Our family and I were hired to work with Shvitlinskin (the oldest of the town). The family of Fethiye Blatt were also hired by him, and thus they were temporarily saved from deportation. .


Different decrees were issued every day, and whoever violated them was set to receive the death penalty, except for the decree of a curfew in the homes in the evenings, which everyone found after the curfew. If one put his life on the line, the Jews understood that their life had become a sacrifice for anyone who wanted to get over them. We are standing in Svitlinski's yard, and two German guys on bicycles pass by, and one calls out to the other: There are Jews! They came to the yard, pulled out their revolvers, and ordered my father, Avraham Seidel - who happened to be in this farm - and Fethia Blatt's wife - Rachel to go after them, they took them to the cemetery and murdered them. .


The deportation of Lord Adele Jews On a summer day in 1942, the Germans published an order that all Horodler Jews should be deported to Ochan. This was the most terrible decision, for which we were all so afraid. Although not everyone accepted that a general deportation meant the destruction of the Jews in the death camps. In accordance with the decree, all the Jews: men, women and children, lined up in the market, and from there the whole community was led to Ochan. .
