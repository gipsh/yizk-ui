They took us out of the wagons and they led us to the stove. When we arrived at Staro. Our camp numbered around 500 people. The guards - the murderers - led us into an abandoned flour mill. And they immediately brought me to work in the kitchen. The conditions in this camp were terrible and the mortality rate among the deportees was high. I knew that I would not be able to endure here and I decided to run away. After a lot of effort, I escaped from the camp and arrived in Helles and entered the Jewish ghetto. In the ghetto, I met both daughters of Fethia Blatt, who had recently been living in Kelem. The Blatt sisters helped me a lot financially, and in the end I escaped from the ghetto. After my escape from the ghetto, I lived under an assumed name until the end of the war. .


After the end of the war, I decided to leave this blood-soaked Poland, and I went to America, to New York. I live here with my oldest brother Shmuel, and with my oldest sister Sarah. My parents died in the Holocaust along with my young sister Toibe. Of my uncle's family, which numbered seven souls, no one survived. .
