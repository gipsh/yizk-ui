Because of his work, my grandfather used to spend a long time in Warsaw and other big cities, and used to return home on good days for longer vacations. Because of his living in big cities and because of his many trips to different cities, he acquired urban manners and a lot of experience in world practices. Of course, the appearance of the grandfather in Haradla, after spending many months in the big world, made an impression in the town and disturbed our home. .


I still remember the great preparations in my grandfather's house, in our home and in the houses of the uncles, before the arrival of the grandfather. On the day of his arrival, our mother used to dress us, the grandchildren, in holiday clothes, and we ran to our grandfather to pick him up. who used to go specially to the railway station to bring the grandfather who was returning home. The grandfather did not return home empty-handed, and we, the grandchildren, used to look with curiosity at the large and heavy suitcases that were removed from the wagon and we tried to guess what gifts he brought his grandchildren. .


With great respect and kindness, the Hasidic of Shtibel took my grandfather up, after saying goodbye, they sat him down in a dignified place and gathered around him to hear the world news and what was happening in the court of the Rabbi of Radzin. In the good old days, the grandfather was honored by saying tal and rain as an expression of respect and affection. .


The family manners that prevailed in Zayden's home were the manners of a noble, virtuous and pious home. It is etched in my memory mutual understanding. The mutual and loving relations of the grandfather and grandmother, their family life full of silence and nobility, were a pattern of honor and an example in our family. .
