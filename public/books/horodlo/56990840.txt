Fon a bridegroom who is accepting a bride, on mit enthusiasm Roft er zu ir oys, come bride, get up bride! On enough bride there is no full grace and a queen (Shabbat Malkta)
During this exaltation comes out of his mouth: psalm for Shabbat
good to thank her
A song of Shabbat, it is good to thank God
11
He is overflowing with gratitude, the ego, for these exalted moments, and now he remembers himself in the fourth commandment of the Ten Commandments: And the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath and observe the sanctity of the Sabbath (You sanctified the seventh day) and The greatness of this day, which was created and commanded to be observed, and has been sanctified and blessed since the six days of Genesis, because God blesses the day of the Sabbath and sanctifies it because it is the Sabbath of all his work that God created to do.
And Gt blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it he rested from all his work that Gt had created, and therefore he is happy in himself and spends as it is written: Ishmachu Bmaltoch Shumari Shabbat ukurai eng, and he prays With intention: God bless our ancestors, please let us rest and he tells about the greatness of G-d who is the protector of our ancestors in his words and he is the God who is not equal, the one who rests for him on his holy Sabbath, he gives what is not as he gives you his people in his holy Shabbat, and therefore before him we worship with reverence and fear and praise to his name, we will serve him with fear and awe and give thanks to his name


 


He goes home with joy, after pouring out his prayer in the shell. And here he meets important and pleasant guests of God's angels, and he gives them a warm and heartfelt peace, he knows that the Lord of the world loves him, just as he loves the Supreme, and therefore he has him. Sent angels to bless him (peace be upon him) and to guard him (for his angels will command you to guard you in all your ways). He escorts his guests out safely and prepares for the Sabbath feast. .


A lightness and cleanliness has spread over the house, and a pleasant smell of spices can be felt. He remembers that this.
