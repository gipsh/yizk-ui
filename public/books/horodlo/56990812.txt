gave birth to him sixteen children of whom only three daughters remained
I remember how one of his daughters and his wife died in almost being touched by grief, and how his youngest son died, whom the rabbi loved very much and he was his beloved child, this boy. Had to say Kaddish after the death of the father, the death of this child had a heavy effect on the rabbi's mood, then the butcher Rabbi Jacob Zal came and in order to comfort him, he told him the following story: Both sons of Rabbi Meir Died in the day
His wife, who did not want to share the news at once, met him at the entrance of the house, while returning from the synagogue, and she asked him: A few years ago, a man came to me and gave me a very expensive pawn. Watch
And I was happy that the pawned property was with me and I considered it as if it were my private property, and today that man came and asked me to return his pawn, what do I need, according to your opinion? Do? Rabbi Meir I immediately replied: Of course you have to give him up
They took him to the children's room and he saw his two dear children dead
He raised his hands and said: God gave and God took away, the visit and the fur of the butcher had a good effect on the rabbi and he felt


comforted and began to return to his usual life. Just like the prayer of Jacob our father at G: Bread to eat and clothes to wear. The rabbi obtained this with great effort and in various ways. And he did not eat his bread from the teachers. He inherited his house and rented several rooms to others. He also had good fortune, especially for the Christians of the area, he had a rich brother in Ludmir, a sister in America and a brother in England. And they didn't forget that they had a brother who was a teacher, he used to always tell about a dream he had, that his father came to him and he left a bookcase for him and a bag of money for his brother in Ludmir. Therefore he remained a poor man.
