Canada. .


I miss home. .


When the Germans came to drive us, they killed us immediately. I had to go to Russia because I parted with my mother so young. .


I left laughing, I left my sweet home.


I did not know it would take years and I would not be able to see my mother. .


Bad letters, I remembered that they are tortured there: at home with the children, she lies hidden and life inside is so difficult. .


When there was peace in the world and I was sitting at home, time passed like a dream. But I can't forget this. .


I also remember my town. My homeland, oh how beautiful! I miss my mom, when can I see all this? .
