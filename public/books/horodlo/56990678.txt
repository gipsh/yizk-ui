Research University in Jerusalem. The whole town was under the impression of our celebration, which was organized with great splendor and which awakened in us a longing for the Land of Israel. .


Under the influence of Mordechai Friend, we began to try our hand at writing songs and articles, and we read them aloud at our friends' parties. I remember how our dear friend Jacob (Yankele) Gruber Zel wrote a song about Hanukkah, which was called Hanrut Hallu, which he read at the Hanukkah ceremony that we performed. Yankele read the poem with great enthusiasm and pathos. But the society was not greatly enthused by his poem and his reading, and began to make different comments. But our friend Yankele did not get confused, interrupted his reading for a while and said with his wonderful innocence: - What? You don't like that? It's not that dangerous, but let me finish reading it first and then we'll cut it. Upon hearing his words, which were uttered with innocence seasoned with a thin humor, a loud laugh broke out in Zol. .


Mordechai Freind left Horodla after a period of many TET chains, and the teacher Kolodnicki from Bialystok came in his place. It seemed that he came to our city to study Hebi Reish. However, as it turns out, he had a completely different task. His attitudes were communist, and instead of teaching Hebrew, he fed his students with communist ideas, and without realizing it, a number of his students were infected with his attitudes. .


When it became clear to us his true intentions, a large part of his students left him, and a small part stayed with him to teach, in the end he was left with none and he left Horodla. It was only a short time until a guest came to us from Harobyshov by the name of Tzvi Platt, who stayed with us for a while.
