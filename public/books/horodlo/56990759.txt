H. The new one comes to Senis in winter. At the approach of winter, we were already able to place the above-mentioned farmer, without payment, for a shelter in his Ferdi stables, our shelter was now very comfortable, while our experience in shelters was a great one. During the day we used to lie in our hiding place and at night we used to move around a lot, and we used to bring the guy good things. We spent the whole winter in this shelter.


T. When the summer came again, we left our hiding place and we returned to the summer hiding place - in the fields. We could see that the roads were full of retreating Germans. We understood that the front was approaching, and we anxiously looked forward to our liberation by the advancing Russians. We hid well among the grain, and we were careful not to be discovered by the Germans who filled the whole area. .


At night we used to come out from among the grain and we used to turn around to see what was happening in our environment. We approached the village of Lushkov, which was very close to the front. On the way to Luzhkov, we saw a German car standing on the side of the road. We went with great caution to and we saw that the driver was sleeping strapped to the wheel and gave him - .


His gun. My brother David cut the tarp over and took out the gun, and we quickly left the place and returned to our hiding place. We appeared to see the large arch bridge near Ustila burning and we understood that the Germans had already been kicked out of Ustila. My brother Shmuel and my sister-in-law Genie then left to look for stone in the economy of Ragl, according to what I was told later.
