Dear Haradler Jews! It hurts my heart that I have to tell my memories about Horodla and her close people, precisely on the pages of a book of remembrance, a book about a town and a community that was and was destroyed by the barbarians. A book whose task is to immortalize the Harodler community and the dear Horadler Jews, who were killed by the Holocaust along with millions of European Jews. .


Dear horodler saints! I will remember you all my life. I will interweave your precious memory together with the memory of all the heroes and saints who gave their lives for Kiddush Hashem and for the revival of the people of Israel in the Land of Israel. Let's remember and let's sanctify! .
