You have to prepare for Shabbat, and you also have to live on Shabbat. At home there is no fruit to split and after all the troubles, the good holy days are approaching. And then comes the long cold winter, and the children go around torn and locked, oh! What will I do? Who can understand G-d's will asher yahob yakohim (whom he loves, he chastises). - That's how he used to talk to himself. .


He rarely talks to anyone else
There were only two who knew his mood, and with them he used to talk and pour out his bitter heart for them, these were Mendel Lerner and Nette Ziseles, he used to talk with them about the words of the Torah and save himself about a difficult issue.
This is how they used to share with each other about the state of their market business: the rising price of wheat, the cheapening of barley, the lack of tobacco, and similar matters.
I knew this Jew well
It was enough for me to catch a look at his face, in order to know if today he earned enough money to be his family or not, if divorce helped him and he earned something, he used to walk away and smile and By the way, the guest said: - Well, Melech, did you bathe in the river today? , and what do you hear?
And then I used to say - with a smile - to him: - Now Isaac, what is the smile on your face, and what is the joy? * And he used to answer me: - Go, you're still too young, if a Jew earns something, with God's help, to maintain his life, he should be happy, and he used to hum a song under his breath, but without He used to be very happy that Saturday had come and everything was necessary in his house, then he would take off his Saturday hood and the black velvet cap, he would comb his red beard and go into the shed - in the Radziner Stibel - pray
 


He had a wife, her name was Hashe, and three children: Moshele (a dumb one! La Ã©linum), his second son was Shmuel.
