I was then 20 years old, full of energy and youth, and full of enthusiasm for the Zionist idea, striving to immigrate to the Land of Israel and to be one of its citizens. This was the aspiration that embraced most of the youth of my city. Practically, our entire Zionist work was like a kind of preparation to realize the aspiration of the Olet to be in the Land of Israel and realize the generational dream of the Jewish people. .


Along with my organizational work, I became aware that I need to become a person for myself and organize myself in an independent way, and not be dependent on my father. I accepted myself with courage and told my father about my thoughts and aspirations and about my plan to leave for another city and try to settle for myself there. We both agreed that if out in the wider world, that is to say in another city, this city must be Horadla. Because relatives of my family lived in this town - the family of Mattel Sofer. .


In a winter day, I got up and went to Horodla and I talked with my relatives about my plan to settle in Horodla. On the same evening, I met Meir Zis, my future work partner, and in a few days, on a Tuesday (a day in which it is written twice as auspicious), my father handed me a new car and set off for the road. And I left Harobyshov to try my luck in the world, and I went to Harodla, the small lovely town. .


On the first Saturday of my stay in Horodla, my partner Meir Zis took me to the club at the cultural library, and there I met some colleagues and friends of the Horodla youth, on the same Saturday evening I made acquaintance with Three dear friends: Rachel Zisberg (today my wife), Blume Goldberg and Bracha Chesner, that's how I met Eliezer Goldberg Zel and my good friend Moshe Zuberman (Ivdal Chaim), who is now in Israel. Very interesting for me was that Saturday evening. By the way.
